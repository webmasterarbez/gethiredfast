# Merrill's First Principles of Instruction

## The 5 Principles

### 1. Problem-Centered
Learning happens in context of real-world problems.

**Application:**
- Start with a problem learners care about
- Show the "why" before the "how"
- Use authentic scenarios

### 2. Activation
Connect new information to existing knowledge.

**Application:**
- Reference what learners already know
- Use analogies and metaphors
- Surface prior experience

### 3. Demonstration
Show, don't just tell.

**Application:**
- Provide clear examples
- Show step-by-step processes
- Include non-examples (what NOT to do)
- Use multiple representations

### 4. Application
Let learners practice with feedback.

**Application:**
- Guided practice first (scaffolded)
- Independent practice next
- Immediate, specific feedback
- Decreasing support over time

### 5. Integration
Transfer learning to real life.

**Application:**
- Reflection on learning
- Real-world application planning
- Peer teaching/sharing
- Create something meaningful

## Lesson Blueprint Template

```yaml
lesson:
  # PROBLEM-CENTERED
  problem_context: |
    What real-world problem does this solve?
    Why should learners care?

  # ACTIVATION
  activation:
    prior_knowledge: "What do they already know?"
    connection: "How does this connect?"
    analogy: "What familiar thing is this like?"

  # DEMONSTRATION
  demonstration:
    key_concepts:
      - concept: ""
        explanation: ""
        example: ""

    worked_examples:
      - scenario: ""
        steps: []
        outcome: ""

    non_examples:
      - what: ""
        why_wrong: ""

  # APPLICATION
  application:
    guided:
      - activity: ""
        scaffolding: ""
        feedback: ""

    independent:
      - activity: ""
        success_criteria: ""

  # INTEGRATION
  integration:
    reflection: "Questions to ponder"
    transfer: "How to use this tomorrow"
    share: "How to explain to others"
```
