# Instructional Design Frameworks

Course OS integrates these frameworks throughout all phases.

## ADDIE (Process Structure)

- **Analysis** → Phases 1-3 (Import, Research, Discovery)
- **Design** → Phases 4-5 (Strategy, Architecture)
- **Development** → Phases 6-8 (Content, Scripts, Assessments)
- **Implementation** → Phase 9-10 (Media, Production)
- **Evaluation** → Built into quality gates at each phase

## Bloom's Taxonomy (Learning Objectives)

All learning outcomes must specify cognitive level:

| Level | Description | Verbs |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 6. Create | Produce new work | Design, construct, develop, formulate |
| 5. Evaluate | Justify decisions | Judge, critique, assess, defend |
| 4. Analyze | Break down components | Compare, contrast, examine, differentiate |
| 3. Apply | Use in new situations | Implement, execute, demonstrate |
| 2. Understand | Explain concepts | Explain, describe, summarize |
| 1. Remember | Recall facts | Recall, list, define, identify |

## Gagné's 9 Events (Lesson Structure)

Each lesson should address:

1. Gain attention
2. State objectives
3. Recall prior learning
4. Present content
5. Provide guidance
6. Elicit performance
7. Provide feedback
8. Assess performance
9. Enhance retention/transfer

## Kirkpatrick (Evaluation)

Assessments mapped to 4 levels:

- **Level 1: Reaction** - Learner satisfaction
- **Level 2: Learning** - Knowledge/skill acquisition
- **Level 3: Behavior** - Application of learning
- **Level 4: Results** - Business/life outcomes

## Merrill's Principles (Content Design)

- Problem-centered learning
- Activation of prior knowledge
- Demonstration of skills
- Application of skills
- Integration into real-world

## Accessibility Standards

All content must meet:

- **WCAG 2.1 AA** - Technical accessibility
- **UDL Principles** - Universal Design for Learning
