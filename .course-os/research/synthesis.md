## Executive Summary

The 2025 job market presents a paradox for community college students: entry-level hiring is at a decade low, yet AI skills command premium salaries and those who master modern job search techniques can still succeed. This course must bridge the gap between Cat Breet's proven fundamentals (STAR method, networking, negotiation) and the AI-transformed landscape of 2025.

### Key Statistics That Define the Landscape

| Metric | Value | Implication |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Entry-level hiring | Down 44% from 2022 | Competition is intense |
| Average job search | 6.4 months | Start early |
| Applications per student | 10 (up from 6) | Quality over quantity matters |
| Jobs through networking | 70% | Network-first strategy essential |
| AI tool usage | 77% of job seekers | AI literacy is table stakes |
| AI skills salary premium | +28% ($18K/year) | AI skills = competitive advantage |
| First-gen students not using career services | 35% | Targeted outreach needed |
| Gen Z using TikTok for career | 46% secured jobs | Meet students where they are |

## Core Themes Emerging

### 1. AI is Both Threat and Opportunity

**Threat:**
- AI is automating entry-level roles
- AI screening (HireVue, ATS) can reject good candidates
- College degree advantage is narrowing

**Opportunity:**
- AI tools accelerate job search 3x
- AI literacy commands premium salaries
- Those who master AI + human skills thrive

**Teaching Implication:**
Position AI as a tool to be mastered, not feared. Students need both AI literacy AND the human skills AI can't replace.

### 2. Experience is Currency, Not Credentials

The shift from credential-based to skills-based hiring means:
- **Degrees matter less** than demonstrable skills
- **Internships/projects matter more** than GPA
- **Portfolios beat transcripts**

**Teaching Implication:**
Help students recognize, frame, and articulate their experience — even if it's "just" part-time work, class projects, or volunteer activities.

### 3. Networks are Non-Negotiable

With 70% of jobs coming through networking and 80% never posted:
- First-gen students are at structural disadvantage
- Networking skills are learnable, not innate
- Scripts and strategies reduce anxiety

**Teaching Implication:**
Preserve and expand Cat Breet's networking content. Add first-gen specific guidance and informational interview scripts.

### 4. Imposter Syndrome is Universal

70% of people experience it, but it hits harder for:
- First-generation students
- Students with limited work experience
- Those entering professional world for first time

**Teaching Implication:**
The course's mindset content is a competitive advantage. Emphasize it even more for this audience.

### 5. Modern Platforms Require Modern Strategies

Students are on TikTok, Discord, and Handshake — not (only) LinkedIn:
- 46% of Gen Z secured jobs through TikTok
- Handshake is the primary college job board
- Social media presence influences employer decisions

**Teaching Implication:**
Add content on Handshake optimization and acknowledge TikTok/Discord as legitimate career resources while cautioning about misinformation.

## Key Teaching Principles

Based on research, the course should:

1. **Lead with empathy** — Students are anxious, overwhelmed, and often experiencing imposter syndrome

2. **Provide scripts and templates** — Reduce activation energy for scary tasks like networking

3. **Balance AI and human** — AI is a tool; human skills (relationships, judgment, creativity) still win

4. **Use student language** — "WTF should I do?" not "career exploration"

5. **Make it actionable** — Every lesson should end with a clear next step

6. **Track progress** — Daily Action Tracker is competitive advantage; keep it

7. **Meet them on their platforms** — Reference TikTok, Discord alongside LinkedIn

8. **Address first-gen specifically** — 50% of CC students are first-gen
