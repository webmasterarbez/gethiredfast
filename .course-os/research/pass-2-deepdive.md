## 1. ChatGPT Prompts for Resume Writing

### Why Use AI for Resumes

- AI quickly generates tailored content for different applications
- Enables personalization aligned with specific job descriptions
- Quality depends on prompt specificity

### Best Resume Prompts

#### For Creating Bullet Points
```
Write 3 resume bullet points for a [Job Title] demonstrating
leadership and measurable impact.
```

```
Rewrite my resume bullet points to sound more results-oriented
and include these quantifiable achievements: [ACHIEVEMENT 1,
ACHIEVEMENT 2, ACHIEVEMENT 3].
```

#### For Professional Summary
```
Using my resume below, write 5-7 sentences to summarize my
professional experience, including only what's relevant to
the [INSERT JOB TITLE] job description. Highlight my [X] years
of experience in [INSERT INDUSTRY]. Showcase how my experience
can address [COMPANY NAME]'s pain points. Write it using resume
language (passive third person).
```

#### For No-Experience Students
```
Transform this student activity into a quantified achievement:
[paste activity]. Include metrics, percentages, or numbers that
demonstrate impact. Use format: Action Verb + Task + Result.
```

#### For ATS Optimization
```
Review this job description and identify the top 10 keywords
I should include in my resume: [paste job description]. Then
suggest how to naturally incorporate them into my experience
bullets.
```

### Prompting Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Be specific about industry and role | Use vague requests |
| Include context about your background | Expect perfect output first try |
| Ask for action verbs and metrics | Accept made-up numbers (fact-check!) |
| Request ATS-friendly language | Use output verbatim (edit for voice) |

### Important Caution
> "ChatGPT sometimes makes up numbers. If you don't provide specific metrics, the AI may insert its own. Always fact-check everything before using it."

## 2. STAR Method for Behavioral Interviews

### What is STAR?

| Component | Description | Time Allocation |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **S**ituation | Context and background | 20% |
| **T**ask | Your responsibility/goal | 10% |
| **A**ction | What YOU did (not the team) | 60% |
| **R**esult | Outcomes, ideally quantified | 10% |

### Common Behavioral Questions

- "Tell me about a time when you worked as part of a team..."
- "Describe a time when you had a tight deadline..."
- "Give me an example of a time when you failed..."
- "Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a coworker..."
- "What is your greatest accomplishment?"

### Example STAR Answer (Entry-Level)

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you worked on a team project."

**S:** "In my marketing class last semester, our team of four was assigned to create a social media campaign for a local business."

**T:** "I was responsible for coordinating our timeline and managing our shared documents to ensure we met our deadline."

**A:** "I created a shared project board in Trello, set up weekly check-ins, and when our graphic designer fell behind, I stepped in to help with basic image editing so we wouldn't miss our milestone."

**R:** "We delivered our campaign two days early, received an A on the project, and the business owner actually used one of our Instagram post concepts."

### For Students with Limited Work Experience

Use examples from:
- Class projects
- Volunteer work
- Student organizations
- Part-time jobs (any!)
- Sports teams
- Family responsibilities

### Preparation Tips

1. **Prepare 3-5 stories** covering different competencies
2. **Create bullet outlines**, don't memorize scripts
3. **Vary your examples** — don't use one source for everything
4. **Take time if needed** — asking for a moment to think is OK
5. **Real examples beat hypotheticals** — "I did..." > "I would..."

## 6. Overcoming Imposter Syndrome

### The Scope

- **70% of people** experience imposter syndrome at some point
- Especially affects high achievers, perfectionists, and first-gen students
- Common among job seekers and new graduates

### How It Shows Up

| Symptom | Impact on Job Search |
|---------|---------------------|
| Self-doubt | Avoid applying to "reach" positions |
| Fear of being "found out" | Underperform in interviews |
| Attributing success to luck | Downplay accomplishments on resume |
| Feeling like a fraud | Struggle to network authentically |
| Perfectionism paralysis | Over-prepare but never apply |

### First-Gen Students

> "When first-generation students begin college, it's easy for them to feel like they don't belong, as if they've somehow tricked everyone into letting them be there."

Additional challenges:
- No family guidance on professional norms
- Shame, guilt, and embarrassment carry into career
- Confidence critical for networking/interviewing

### Strategies to Overcome

#### 1. Acknowledge Your Feelings
Recognize imposter syndrome is common and doesn't reflect reality.

#### 2. Keep a "Win Journal"
Document achievements and positive feedback. Review when doubts arise.

#### 3. Challenge Negative Thoughts
Ask: "What evidence do I have for this belief? What evidence contradicts it?"

#### 4. Reframe "Failure"
Embrace vulnerability as growth opportunity, not weakness.

#### 5. Talk About It
Share feelings with trusted friends, mentors, or counselors. You're not alone.

#### 6. Prepare Thoroughly
Confidence comes from preparation. Research companies, practice answers.

#### 7. Ask Questions
Curiosity builds confidence. Asking questions shows engagement, not weakness.

#### 8. Give Yourself Permission to Be "In Progress"
> "You're not supposed to know everything. You're supposed to be learning. That person crushing it on your team? They were once the newbie too."
