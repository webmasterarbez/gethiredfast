# JOB SEARCH MISCONCEPTIONS
# =============================================================================

job_search:

  - id: misc-001
    misconception: "I should apply to as many jobs as possible"
    truth: |
      Quality beats quantity. Tailored applications to fewer, well-matched
      jobs yield better results than mass applications.
    evidence: |
      Despite applying to 10 jobs on average (up from 6), Class of 2025
      received fewer offers than 2024. Targeted applications work better.
    teaching_approach: |
      Explain the 80/20 rule: 80% of effort on 20% of best-fit jobs.
      Teach job description analysis and tailoring.
    related_concepts:
      - ats-optimization
      - keywords
      - hidden-job-market

  - id: misc-002
    misconception: "Job boards are the best way to find a job"
    truth: |
      70% of jobs are filled through networking. Only 20% of jobs are
      ever posted publicly. Online applications are least effective channel.
    evidence: |
      LinkedIn survey data on networking success rates; referral
      candidates hired 55% faster with higher retention.
    teaching_approach: |
      Lead with hidden job market statistics. Use Cat Breet's networking
      content to show HOW to network effectively.
    related_concepts:
      - hidden-job-market
      - networking
      - informational-interviews

  - id: misc-003
    misconception: "I need experience to get experience (Catch-22)"
    truth: |
      Students have more experience than they realize. Class projects,
      part-time jobs, volunteering, and activities all count.
    evidence: |
      Skills-based hiring means demonstrated abilities matter more than
      formal work history. Reframing student activities works.
    teaching_approach: |
      Use exercises to extract transferable skills from existing
      activities. Shift mindset: "Student IS a job."
    related_concepts:
      - transferable-skills
      - limited-experience

  - id: misc-004
    misconception: "My GPA is what matters most"
    truth: |
      Internships, projects, and demonstrated skills matter more than
      GPA in most fields. Experience trumps grades.
    evidence: |
      Students with internships earn $15K more on average than those
      without. Skills-based hiring prioritizes portfolios over transcripts.
    teaching_approach: |
      If GPA is strong (3.5+), include it. If not, focus energy on
      building experience and skills to highlight instead.

# =============================================================================
# RESUME MISCONCEPTIONS
# =============================================================================

resume:

  - id: misc-005
    misconception: "I need a fancy resume design to stand out"
    truth: |
      Simple, clean formatting works best. Fancy designs often fail ATS
      screening, preventing human review entirely.
    evidence: |
      97.8% of Fortune 500 use ATS. 75%+ of resumes rejected before
      human review. Tables, graphics, and columns cause parsing failures.
    teaching_approach: |
      Show examples of ATS failures. Teach simple formatting that
      passes machines AND looks professional to humans.
    related_concepts:
      - ats-optimization
      - resume

  - id: misc-006
    misconception: "I should put everything I've ever done on my resume"
    truth: |
      Tailor your resume to each job. Only include relevant experience
      and skills that match what the employer is seeking.
    evidence: |
      Tailored resumes score higher on ATS match rates. Recruiters
      spend only 6 seconds scanning; irrelevant content wastes time.
    teaching_approach: |
      Teach master resume concept (everything) vs. tailored resume
      (customized for each application).
    related_concepts:
      - resume
      - keywords
      - ats-optimization

  - id: misc-007
    misconception: "AI can write my entire resume for me"
    truth: |
      AI is a tool, not a replacement. AI-generated content without
      editing sounds generic and recruiters can detect it.
    evidence: |
      "Recruiters are catching on to AI phrasing." AI sometimes makes up
      numbers. Human editing and personalization are essential.
    teaching_approach: |
      Teach AI as brainstorming tool. Always edit output. Fact-check
      any numbers. Add personal voice and specific details.

# =============================================================================
# INTERVIEW MISCONCEPTIONS
# =============================================================================

interviews:

  - id: misc-008
    misconception: "I should memorize perfect answers to interview questions"
    truth: |
      Memorized answers sound robotic. Prepare key points and stories,
      but deliver naturally in the moment.
    evidence: |
      MIT Career Advising recommends "bulleted outlines" not scripts.
      Authentic delivery builds rapport; memorization sounds rehearsed.
    teaching_approach: |
      Teach STAR framework for structure. Practice stories multiple
      times but never word-for-word memorization.
    related_concepts:
      - star-method
      - behavioral-interviews
      - interview-preparation

  - id: misc-009
    misconception: "If I don't meet every requirement, I shouldn't apply"
    truth: |
      Job postings describe ideal candidates, not minimum requirements.
      If you meet 60-70% of qualifications, apply anyway.
    evidence: |
      Men apply at 60% match; women often wait for 100%. The "perfect"
      candidate rarely exists. Transferable skills can fill gaps.
    teaching_approach: |
      Teach students to evaluate "required" vs "preferred" qualifications.
      Address imposter syndrome that drives self-selection.
    related_concepts:
      - imposter-syndrome
      - confidence-building
      - limited-experience

  - id: misc-010
    misconception: "I can trick the AI interview system"
    truth: |
      There's no course that will help you game AI assessments. Focus
      on genuine preparation and authentic presentation.
    evidence: |
      HireVue explicitly states no gaming possible. AI measures genuine
      communication quality, not tricks.
    teaching_approach: |
      Focus on solid preparation: STAR method, clear speaking, positive
      energy. Technical setup matters. Practice with platform's tools.

# =============================================================================
# NETWORKING MISCONCEPTIONS
# =============================================================================

networking:

  - id: misc-011
    misconception: "Networking is fake and manipulative"
    truth: |
      Authentic networking is about building genuine relationships and
      helping each other, not transactional manipulation.
    evidence: |
      Informational interviews increase response rates by 45%. Most
      professionals enjoy helping students and new grads.
    teaching_approach: |
      Reframe networking as relationship building. Use "give first"
      mindset. Focus on genuine curiosity about others' paths.
    related_concepts:
      - networking
      - informational-interviews

  - id: misc-012
    misconception: "I don't know anyone useful for networking"
    truth: |
      Everyone has a network to start with: family, friends, professors,
      classmates, past coworkers, neighbors, etc.
    evidence: |
      "First 50" exercise uncovers existing connections. LinkedIn
      2nd-degree connections expand reach significantly.
    teaching_approach: |
      Start with existing relationships. Teach how to ask for
      introductions. Use LinkedIn to find 2nd-degree connections.
    related_concepts:
      - networking
      - first-gen-challenges
      - linkedin-profile

  - id: misc-013
    misconception: "Networking only works for extroverts"
    truth: |
      Introverts have natural advantages: better listening (37%),
      preference for depth over breadth, thoughtful engagement.
    evidence: |
      Research shows introverts get 42% more valuable connections from
      smaller events. One-on-one follow-up yields 44% higher relationship value.
    teaching_approach: |
      Teach introvert-friendly strategies: small gatherings, online
      networking, content creation, one-on-one coffee chats.

# =============================================================================
# SALARY & NEGOTIATION MISCONCEPTIONS
# =============================================================================

negotiation:

  - id: misc-014
    misconception: "Entry-level jobs don't allow negotiation"
    truth: |
      84% of employers are willing to increase initial offers. Only 10%
      ever withdraw an offer for negotiating. It's expected.
    evidence: |
      Only 38% of grads negotiate. Those who do can increase offers
      by up to 10%. Even 5% compounds over career.
    teaching_approach: |
      Normalize negotiation. Teach what IS negotiable at entry level
      (start date, PTO, remote days, tuition reimbursement).
    related_concepts:
      - salary-negotiation
      - total-compensation

  - id: misc-015
    misconception: "I should accept the first offer immediately"
    truth: |
      Taking time to evaluate is expected and professional. Ask for
      2-3 days to review the full offer and compensation package.
    evidence: |
      Employers expect some negotiation. Rushing to accept leaves
      money on the table and shows lack of strategic thinking.
    teaching_approach: |
      Teach how to ask for time professionally. Provide scripts.
      Explain total compensation evaluation beyond base salary.
    related_concepts:
      - offer-evaluation

# =============================================================================

ai_technology:

  - id: misc-016
    misconception: "AI is going to take all the jobs"
    truth: |
      AI is changing jobs, not eliminating all of them. Some roles
      shrink, others grow, many transform. Human skills remain critical.
    evidence: |
      AI skills command 28% salary premium. Human skills (creativity,
      emotional intelligence, judgment) can't be automated.
    teaching_approach: |
      Balanced perspective: acknowledge disruption, focus on adaptation.
      Teach AI literacy as career insurance.
    related_concepts:
      - ai-career-impact

      - transferable-skills

  - id: misc-017
    misconception: "I don't need to learn AI tools"
    truth: |
      77% of job seekers already use AI. AI literacy is now an
      expectation, not a bonus. Those without it are disadvantaged.
    evidence: |
      Job postings requiring AI skills up 109% in one year. AI-savvy
      candidates land interviews 3x faster with proper prompting.
    teaching_approach: |
      Make AI tools accessible and practical. Start with basics:
      ChatGPT for brainstorming, Jobscan for ATS. Build from there.

      72% of recruiters use LinkedIn actively. Complete profiles get
      40x more opportunities. Essential for all job seekers.

mindset:

  - id: misc-019
    misconception: "Everyone else knows what they're doing except me"
    truth: |
      70% of people experience imposter syndrome. Most professionals
      were once uncertain beginners. This is a universal experience.
    evidence: |
      Research on imposter syndrome prevalence. First-gen students
      especially affected but it's widespread across all backgrounds.
    teaching_approach: |

  - id: misc-020
    misconception: "If I get rejected, I must not be good enough"
    truth: |
      Rejection is normal and expected in job searching. It's often
      about fit, timing, or factors beyond your control.
    evidence: |
      Average job search requires many applications. Hiring decisions
      involve many variables. One rejection means nothing about worth.
    teaching_approach: |
      Normalize rejection. Teach to focus on what's controllable
      (activity, preparation, outreach) not outcomes.
    related_concepts:
      - confidence-building
      - imposter-syndrome

  - id: misc-021

      candidates who seek to understand, not those who pretend to know.
    evidence: |
      "Curiosity builds confidence." Asking questions in interviews
      is expected and shows genuine interest.

      to ask in interviews and informational conversations.
