    question: "Tell me about a time you worked effectively on a team."
    experience_source: "Retail job during holiday season"

    story:
      situation: |
        Last Black Friday, our Target store was preparing for the biggest
        sales day of the year. We had double the usual staff and triple
        the usual customers. (20 seconds)

      task: |
        As a team member in electronics, I was responsible for coordinating
        with 4 other associates to manage the department and prevent
        theft while providing excellent customer service. (15 seconds)

      action: |
        I created a quick visual schedule showing who was on register, who
        was on the floor, and who was handling stock. I set up a group
        text for immediate communication about high-demand items running
        low. When one team member's break ran long, I covered without
        being asked. When a customer got frustrated waiting, I de-escalated
        by offering to check stock in back personally. Throughout the day,
        I checked in with teammates to see if anyone needed support. (60 seconds)

      result: |
        We hit 120% of our department sales goal — the best in the store.
        Zero theft incidents. My manager specifically mentioned our team's
        coordination in the store-wide meeting and asked me to help train
        new hires for the next holiday season. (25 seconds)

    question: "Describe a time you collaborated with others on a project."
    experience_source: "Marketing class group project"

    story:
      situation: |
        In my marketing class last spring, we were assigned a group project
        to create a marketing plan for a real local business — a new coffee
        shop near campus. Two weeks before the deadline, one of our four
        team members dropped the class. (20 seconds)

      task: |
        As project lead, I needed to redistribute the work, keep us on
        schedule, and make sure we delivered a quality product. (15 seconds)

      action: |
        I immediately called an emergency meeting. We listed all remaining
        tasks and the skills each person had. I took on the competitive
        analysis myself since I had research experience. I created a
        compressed timeline with daily checkpoints. I set up a shared
        Google Doc where we could all see progress in real-time. I also
        reached out to the coffee shop owner to manage their expectations
        about our timeline. Every night, I reviewed what everyone submitted
        and gave feedback so we could iterate quickly. (65 seconds)

      result: |
        We delivered on time with a 30-page marketing plan. We received
        the highest grade in the class — a 98. The coffee shop owner
        implemented three of our five recommendations, including our
        social media strategy. The professor used our project as an
        example for future classes. (25 seconds)

    question: "Tell me about a challenging problem you solved."
    experience_source: "Balancing work and school during family emergency"

    story:
      situation: |
        Last year, my family had an unexpected financial emergency. My
        mom's hours got cut, and I needed to increase my income while
        also maintaining my full-time class schedule and keeping my GPA
        up for my scholarship. (20 seconds)

      task: |
        I needed to work at least 30 hours a week — up from 20 — while
        taking 15 credits and maintaining a 3.2 GPA minimum for financial
        aid. (15 seconds)

      action: |
        First, I negotiated with my manager for a more flexible schedule
        that worked around my classes. I was honest about why I needed
        more hours, and she was supportive. Then I completely restructured
        my week using time-blocking — every hour was scheduled for either
        work, class, study, or sleep. I identified my hardest class and
        formed a study group so we could teach each other and study more
        efficiently. I also met with my professors during office hours
        to let them know my situation — not for special treatment, but
        so they knew I was committed. I cut out all time-wasters like
        late-night gaming and social scrolling. (70 seconds)

      result: |
        I worked 32 hours a week on average, finished the semester with
        a 3.4 GPA — actually higher than before — and got promoted to
        shift lead at work. The experience taught me time management
        skills I still use every day, and it proved to me that I can
        handle pressure. (25 seconds)

    question: "Describe a time you had to figure something out with limited information."
    experience_source: "Technology troubleshooting at work"

    story:
      situation: |
        At my work-study job in the admissions office, the main computer
        system crashed during peak registration week. Hundreds of students
        were trying to register, and our IT department was backed up for
        hours. (20 seconds)

      task: |
        As the student worker at the front desk, I needed to find a way
        to help students while we waited for IT, even though I wasn't
        trained on system troubleshooting. (15 seconds)

      action: |
        First, I documented the exact error message and steps that led to
        the crash — I knew IT would need this. Then I remembered we had
        a backup laptop that hadn't been set up yet. I found the setup
        instructions online and got it connected to the network myself.
        While that was happening, I created a paper sign-up sheet to
        capture student information so we could follow up. I also drafted
        a quick email template for my supervisor to send to waiting
        students with next steps. When IT finally arrived, I had already
        solved 80% of the problem. (65 seconds)

      result: |
        We were back online in 2 hours instead of the estimated 6. My
        supervisor submitted me for a student employee recognition award,
        which I received. IT also asked if I wanted to be a student tech
        assistant, which I am now. (25 seconds)

customer_service:

  - id: star-005
    question: "Tell me about a time you dealt with a difficult customer."
    experience_source: "Restaurant server experience"

    story:
      situation: |
        I was working as a server at Applebee's on a busy Friday night.
        A customer received their steak cooked medium-well instead of
        medium-rare as ordered. They were visibly upset and started
        raising their voice. Other tables were noticing. (20 seconds)

      task: |
        I needed to resolve the situation, keep the customer from
        escalating further, and make sure our other guests weren't
        negatively affected. (15 seconds)

      action: |
        First, I apologized sincerely without making excuses — I said
        "I'm really sorry this happened. Let me make it right." I didn't
        argue about whose fault it was. I immediately took the steak
        back and personally walked it to the kitchen to explain the
        priority. While waiting, I brought the customer a free appetizer
        and refilled their drinks. I checked in every few minutes so
        they knew they weren't forgotten. When the new steak came out,
        I had the manager come with me to personally apologize and offer
        a discount on their meal. (60 seconds)

      result: |
        The customer calmed down, enjoyed their meal, and left a 25% tip
        — above their usual 15%. They even asked for me by name on their
        next visit. My manager used this as a training example for new
        servers on how to handle complaints. (25 seconds)

# LEADERSHIP/INITIATIVE EXAMPLES
# =============================================================================

leadership:

  - id: star-006
    question: "Tell me about a time you took initiative without being asked."
    experience_source: "Student organization involvement"

    story:
      situation: |
        I'm a member of the Business Club at my community college. Last
        fall, attendance at our meetings dropped from 30 people to about
        10, and fewer students were showing up to networking events with
        local professionals. (20 seconds)

      task: |
        Although I wasn't an officer, I saw the club struggling and felt
        like I could help turn things around. (10 seconds)

      action: |
        I approached the club president with an idea: instead of just
        meetings, we should create more value for members. I volunteered
        to survey members about what they wanted. Based on feedback, I
        proposed monthly skill workshops — like LinkedIn optimization
        and interview prep. I created Instagram content to promote events,
        since our target audience wasn't checking emails. I also reached
        out to local businesses to find speakers and even secured a
        sponsorship from a local bank. Each week, I posted reminders
        and follow-ups. (65 seconds)

      result: |
        Within two months, meeting attendance tripled back to 30+. Our
        LinkedIn workshop had 45 attendees — a record. The bank sponsor
        offered internships to three of our members. I was elected
        Vice President for the following year. (25 seconds)

# FAILURE/LEARNING EXAMPLES
# =============================================================================

failure_learning:

  - id: star-007
    question: "Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned."
    experience_source: "Academic experience"

    story:
      situation: |
        In my first semester of community college, I took on too much.
        I signed up for 18 credits, joined two clubs, and kept my
        20-hour-a-week job. I thought I could handle it. (20 seconds)

      task: |
        By midterms, I was failing my accounting class and barely passing
        two others. I had to figure out how to salvage the semester without
        losing my financial aid. (15 seconds)

      action: |
        First, I got honest with myself about what went wrong — I was
        overcommitted and too proud to ask for help. I went to my academic
        advisor and together we created a recovery plan. I dropped one
        class to focus on the others. I visited the tutoring center
        three times a week for accounting. I scaled back my club
        involvement to one meeting per month instead of every week.
        I told my manager I needed to reduce to 15 hours temporarily.
        Most importantly, I created a study schedule I actually followed
        and started using a planner religiously. (65 seconds)

      result: |
        I finished the semester with a 3.0 — not my goal, but passing.
        More importantly, I learned how to plan realistically, ask for
        help early, and prioritize. I've gotten 3.5+ every semester since
        then. I now help other students as a peer advisor, telling them
        it's okay to adjust — you don't have to do everything at once. (30 seconds)
