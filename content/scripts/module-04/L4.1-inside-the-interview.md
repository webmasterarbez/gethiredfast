## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

After 22 years of interviewing candidates, I can tell you: most people prepare for the wrong things.

They memorize answers instead of stories. They focus on seeming smart instead of seeming human. They rehearse when they should be reflecting.

Let me show you what actually matters from the other side of the table.

## SECTION 1: The 3 Things Interviewers Evaluate (0:45-3:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, insider view]

Every interview comes down to three questions in the interviewer's mind:

[GRAPHIC: Three evaluation criteria]

**1. Can you do the job? (Skills)**
Do you have the technical skills, experience, or potential to perform the role?

**2. Will you fit in? (Culture)**
Will you work well with the team? Will you be pleasant to be around every day?

**3. Do you actually want this? (Motivation)**
Are you genuinely interested in this role at this company, or is this just any job?

[VISUAL: Cat, the reality]

Here's the thing: for entry-level roles, most candidates have similar skills. The tie-breaker is almost always fit and motivation.

[GRAPHIC: The hierarchy]

Skills get you to the interview.
Fit and motivation get you the offer.

## SECTION 2: The "Would I Want to Work With This Person?" Test (3:00-4:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical insight]

Let me tell you what's really going through an interviewer's mind:

"Would I want to work with this person every day?"

[GRAPHIC: The likability factor]

That sounds unprofessional, but it's true. If you're competent AND likable, you get hired. If you're competent but off-putting — you don't.

[VISUAL: Cat, what this means]

What makes someone likable in an interview?
- Being warm and genuine
- Listening well
- Being curious about them (not just talking about yourself)
- Acknowledging when you don't know something
- Having some energy and enthusiasm

[VISUAL: Cat, the warning]

This doesn't mean be fake. It means be your best, most engaged, most genuine self.

## SECTION 3: Types of Interviews (4:30-6:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, educational]

Let me quickly cover the interview formats you might encounter:

[GRAPHIC: Phone screen]

**Phone Screen (15-30 min)**
Usually with a recruiter. Testing basic qualifications and communication. Pass this to move forward.

[GRAPHIC: Video interview]

**Video Interview**
Could be live (like Zoom) or recorded (one-way, like HireVue). We'll cover HireVue specifically later.

[GRAPHIC: In-person interview]

**In-Person Interview (1-2 hours)**
Could be one-on-one or panel. The deep dive into your experience and fit.

[GRAPHIC: Panel interview]

**Panel Interview**
Multiple interviewers at once. Make eye contact with whoever asked the question, then briefly include others.

[GRAPHIC: Case interview]

**Case or Practical Interview**
You solve a problem or complete a task. More common in consulting, tech, and some creative roles.

[VISUAL: Cat, preparation]

Each format is a little different, but the core is the same: show you can do the job, you'll fit in, and you're genuinely interested.

## SECTION 4: The Top 5 Interview Mistakes (6:30-9:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, warning mode]

Now let me tell you what kills interviews. I've seen these hundreds of times.

[GRAPHIC: Mistake 1]

**Mistake 1: Not preparing**
Showing up having done zero research on the company. Instant no.

[GRAPHIC: Mistake 2]

**Mistake 2: Rambling answers**
Taking 5 minutes to answer a question that needed 90 seconds. Practice concise responses.

[GRAPHIC: Mistake 3]

**Mistake 3: Speaking negatively**
About former employers, coworkers, or professors. Huge red flag.

[GRAPHIC: Mistake 4]

**Mistake 4: Not having questions**
"No, I think you covered everything." — Shows you're not that interested.

[GRAPHIC: Mistake 5]

**Mistake 5: Being robotic**
Memorizing word-for-word answers and sounding like a script. Be natural.

[VISUAL: Cat, the antidote]

The antidote to all of these? Preparation + authenticity. Know your stories, but don't memorize scripts. Research the company, but stay conversational. Be yourself, but be your best self.
