## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Nothing impresses an interviewer more than a candidate who's done their homework.

Nothing disappoints more than one who hasn't.

When someone asks "What do you know about our company?" and you stammer — you've already lost ground. Let me show you exactly what to research and where to find it.

## OBJECTIVES (0:30-0:45)

## SECTION 1: What to Research (0:45-3:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the essentials]

There are four things to research before any interview:

[GRAPHIC: 4 research areas]

**1. The Company**
- What they do (products, services)
- Their mission and values
- Recent news (last 3-6 months)
- Company size and culture
- Major competitors

**2. The Role**
- Key responsibilities
- Required skills
- Success metrics (if mentioned in posting)
- Team structure (who you'd work with)

**3. The Interviewer(s)**
- Their role and background
- How long they've been there
- Common interests or connections
- Their career path

**4. The Industry**
- Current trends
- Challenges facing the industry
- How this company is positioned

[VISUAL: Cat, prioritization]

If you're short on time, prioritize: Company → Role → Interviewer → Industry.

## SECTION 2: Where to Find It (3:00-5:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, research sources]

Here's where to look for each:

[GRAPHIC: Research sources]

**Company:**
- Company website (About, Careers, News/Blog sections)
- LinkedIn company page
- Recent press releases
- Glassdoor (for employee reviews)
- Google News (search "[Company name] news")

**Role:**
- Job description (read it 3 times — it tells you exactly what they want)
- Similar job postings (to understand the market)
- Glassdoor (for interview questions and role insights)

**Interviewer:**
- LinkedIn profile (click incognito if you don't want them to see)
- Company bio page
- Any articles or talks they've done

**Industry:**
- Industry publications
- Google Trends
- Recent news about sector

[VISUAL: Cat, time investment]

This sounds like a lot, but it takes about 15-20 minutes per interview. That's a small investment for a huge advantage.

## SECTION 3: The 15-Minute Research Routine (5:00-6:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical routine]

Here's my recommended routine:

[GRAPHIC: 15-minute routine]

**Minutes 1-5: Company website**
- Read the "About" and "Mission" pages
- Scan recent news or blog posts
- Note any values or language they emphasize

**Minutes 5-10: Job description deep-read**
- Highlight keywords and requirements
- Note which of your experiences match each requirement
- Write down questions you have about the role

**Minutes 10-13: LinkedIn research**
- Check interviewer profiles
- Note their backgrounds and how they got there
- Look for common connections or interests

**Minutes 13-15: Quick Google**
- "[Company name] news"
- Any recent headlines or developments

[VISUAL: Cat, documentation]

Write this down somewhere. A notes doc, a template, whatever works. You'll reference it before the interview.

---

## SECTION 4: Using Research in Answers (6:30-7:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, application]

Research is useless if you don't use it. Here's how:

[GRAPHIC: Research in action]

**"Why this company?"**
"I was particularly drawn to your mission of [specific mission]. I read about your recent [initiative/news], and it showed me this is a company that actually lives its values."

**"Why this role?"**
"The job description mentioned [specific responsibility], which aligns perfectly with my experience [specific experience]. I'm excited about the opportunity to [specific growth area]."

**"Questions for them?"**
"I saw that [Company] recently [news item]. How has that affected the team's priorities?"

[VISUAL: Cat, the impact]

When you reference specifics, you demonstrate:
- Genuine interest (you actually did research)
- Preparation (you take this seriously)
- Intelligence (you can synthesize information)

That's a powerful combination.
