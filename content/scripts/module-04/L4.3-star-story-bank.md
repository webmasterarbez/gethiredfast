## SECTION 1: The 5 Competency Areas (1:30-3:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, strategy]

Interviewers typically probe 5 main competency areas. You need at least one strong story for each:

[GRAPHIC: 5 competency areas]

**1. Teamwork/Collaboration**
"Tell me about a time you worked on a team."
"How do you handle conflict with coworkers?"

**2. Problem-Solving**
"Describe a challenge you overcame."
"Tell me about a time you had to figure something out."

**3. Leadership/Initiative**
"Tell me about a time you took the lead."
"Describe when you went above and beyond."

**4. Handling Pressure/Stress**
"How do you manage multiple priorities?"
"Describe a high-pressure situation."

**5. Customer/Stakeholder Focus**
"Tell me about a time you dealt with a difficult customer."
"How do you handle competing expectations?"

[VISUAL: Cat, coverage]

If you have one solid story per area, you can answer almost any behavioral question.

---

## SECTION 2: Mining Your Experiences (3:30-6:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, brainstorming]

Now let's find your stories. Look through these experience categories:

[GRAPHIC: Experience sources]

**Work:**
- Part-time jobs
- Gig work
- Internships
- Work-study

**School:**
- Group projects
- Presentations
- Clubs and organizations
- Athletics

**Volunteer:**
- Community service
- Church/organization work
- Event volunteering

**Personal:**
- Family responsibilities
- Caregiving
- Personal projects
- Self-taught skills

[VISUAL: Cat, instruction]

For each competency area, write down 2-3 possible experiences. We'll pick the best one for each.

[GRAPHIC: Pause indicator]

Take 5 minutes to brainstorm. Write down experience ideas for each of the 5 areas.

[VISUAL: Cat, after pause]

Got some experiences identified? Good. Now let's structure them.

---

## SECTION 3: Writing Your Stories (6:00-12:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, writing time]

Now we write. For each story, follow this structure:

[GRAPHIC: STAR template]

**S — Situation (2-3 sentences)**
When and where? What was happening?

**T — Task (1-2 sentences)**
What was YOUR specific responsibility?

**A — Action (5-7 sentences)**
What did YOU do? Multiple specific actions.

**R — Result (2-3 sentences)**
What was the outcome? Quantify if possible.

[VISUAL: Cat, working through it]

Let's do Story 1 together. Pick your teamwork experience.

[GRAPHIC: Story 1 — Teamwork]

Write your answers:

**Situation:** "In [when/where], [what was happening]..."

**Task:** "As [your role], I needed to [your responsibility]..."

**Action:** "I [action 1]. I [action 2]. I [action 3]..." — at least 3-4 specific actions, each starting with "I"

**Result:** "As a result, [what happened]. [Quantify if possible]."

[VISUAL: Cat, timing check]

When you read it aloud, it should be 1.5-2.5 minutes. If it's longer, cut the Situation. If it's shorter, add more Action detail.

[GRAPHIC: Pause for Story 1]

Write your Teamwork story now. Take 3 minutes.

[VISUAL: Cat, moving on]

Got Story 1? Let's keep going.

[GRAPHIC: Stories 2-5 prompts]

**Story 2 — Problem-Solving:**
Think of a time you figured something out, solved a problem, or overcame an obstacle.

**Story 3 — Leadership/Initiative:**
Think of a time you stepped up, took the lead, or went beyond what was expected.

**Story 4 — Pressure/Stress:**
Think of a time you handled multiple priorities or performed under pressure.

**Story 5 — Customer/Stakeholder:**
Think of a time you dealt with a difficult person or competing expectations.

[GRAPHIC: Pause for Stories 2-5]

Write the remaining 4 stories. Take 10 minutes.

## SECTION 4: Practice Out Loud (12:00-16:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, practice time]

Writing is half the battle. Now you need to practice saying them out loud.

[GRAPHIC: Why out loud matters]

Why? Because:
- You'll discover awkward phrasing
- You'll find where you ramble
- You'll get comfortable with the words
- You'll improve timing

[VISUAL: Cat, the exercise]

Here's what to do:

[GRAPHIC: Practice steps]

**Step 1:** Read Story 1 out loud. Time yourself.

**Step 2:** If over 2.5 minutes, cut. If under 1.5 minutes, add detail.

**Step 3:** Repeat without reading — just from memory of key points.

**Step 4:** Repeat for Stories 2-5.

[VISUAL: Cat, tips]

**Tips:**
- You don't need to memorize word-for-word
- Know the key points and let it flow naturally
- It's okay if it's slightly different each time
- Record yourself to hear how you sound

[GRAPHIC: Pause for practice]

Practice all 5 stories out loud. Take 5-10 minutes.

---

## SECTION 5: Story Mapping (16:00-18:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, strategic mapping]

Now let's make sure you can adapt these stories to different questions.

[GRAPHIC: Story mapping exercise]

For each story, list 3-5 questions it could answer:

**Example — Marketing Project Story:**
- "Tell me about a time you worked on a team" ✓
- "Describe a challenge you overcame" ✓
- "Tell me about a time you led a project" ✓
- "How do you handle deadlines?" ✓
- "Describe your experience with clients" ✓

[VISUAL: Cat, the power]

See how one story maps to 5 different questions? That's the efficiency of a story bank.

[GRAPHIC: Mapping exercise]

For each of your 5 stories, write 2-3 questions it could answer. This helps you recognize in an interview which story to pull.

---

## SECTION 6: Keep Growing (18:00-19:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, ongoing development]

Your story bank isn't static. As you have new experiences, add new stories.

[GRAPHIC: Story bank maintenance]

**Add stories when you:**
- Complete a major project
- Overcome a new challenge
- Receive recognition
- Learn a new skill
- Have a notable customer interaction

**Review your bank:**
- Before every interview, read through your stories
- Practice the top 3 most relevant for that role
- Add recent examples that might be more current

[VISUAL: Cat, encouragement]

The students who crush interviews have 8-10 stories to draw from. You're starting with 5. Keep building.

---

## SUMMARY & CTA (19:00-20:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]

[GRAPHIC: Deliverable complete]

**Deliverable: STAR Story Bank (5+ stories)** ✓
