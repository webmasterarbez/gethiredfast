## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Everyone gets nervous before interviews. Even people who've done hundreds of them.

The difference isn't that some people don't get nervous. It's how they handle it.

Let me share what works.

## SECTION 1: Why Everyone Gets Nervous (0:45-2:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, normalizing]

Interview anxiety is biological. Your brain perceives the interview as a threat — will I be rejected? Will I look stupid? — and triggers a stress response.

[GRAPHIC: The stress response]

- Heart rate increases
- Palms sweat
- Thoughts race
- Breathing quickens

This is the same response that helped our ancestors run from predators. It's not designed for interviews, but it activates anyway.

[VISUAL: Cat, the reframe]

Here's the interesting part: the physical sensations of anxiety and excitement are almost identical.

[GRAPHIC: Anxiety vs. Excitement]

**Anxiety:** Fast heart, sweaty palms, butterflies
**Excitement:** Fast heart, sweaty palms, butterflies

Same feelings. Different interpretation.

[VISUAL: Cat, the technique]

Research shows that telling yourself "I'm excited" instead of "I'm nervous" actually improves performance. Your body is ready for action — channel that energy.

## SECTION 2: Pre-Interview Calm Routine (2:00-3:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical strategies]

Here's a 5-minute routine before any interview:

[GRAPHIC: 5-minute routine]

**5 minutes before:**

**1. Breathing (1 min)**
4-7-8 breathing: Inhale 4 seconds, hold 7 seconds, exhale 8 seconds. Repeat 3-4 times. Activates your calm response.

**2. Power pose (1 min)**
Stand tall, hands on hips or arms wide. Studies show this increases confidence chemicals in your brain.

**3. Positive self-talk (1 min)**
Say to yourself: "I'm prepared. I belong here. I have value to offer."

**4. Review key points (2 min)**
Glance at your STAR stories and research notes. Not to memorize — just to prime your brain.

[VISUAL: Cat, where to do this]

Do this in your car, in a bathroom, in a quiet corner. Don't skip it — it works.

## SECTION 3: When You Blank (3:30-4:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, recovery strategies]

What do you do when you freeze on a question?

[GRAPHIC: Recovery strategies]

**1. Pause and breathe**
A 3-second pause feels longer to you than the interviewer. Take a breath.

**2. Ask for clarification**
"Could you repeat that?" or "Could you clarify what you're looking for?" — Buys you time and ensures you answer correctly.

**3. Think out loud (briefly)**
"That's a great question. Let me think for a moment..." — This is normal and shows thoughtfulness.

**4. Bridge to what you know**
"I don't have a direct example of that, but here's a similar situation..." — Better than saying nothing.

[VISUAL: Cat, permission]

It's okay to pause. It's okay to not have a perfect answer. Interviewers are human — they understand.

## SECTION 4: Recovering from a Bad Answer (4:30-5:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, damage control]

What if you give a bad answer and you know it?

[GRAPHIC: Recovery options]

**Option 1: Keep going**
Sometimes you're harder on yourself than the interviewer is. Move on and nail the next question.

**Option 2: Circle back**
"Actually, can I add to my earlier answer about [topic]? I realized a better example..."

**Option 3: Address in thank-you**
If you realize after the interview, mention it briefly: "I've been thinking more about your question regarding [topic], and I wanted to share..."

[VISUAL: Cat, the truth]

One bad answer rarely kills your chances. It's how you handle it that matters. Interviewers are evaluating your overall impression, not individual moments.

---

## SECTION 5: Preparation Is the Best Medicine (5:30-5:50)

[VISUAL: Cat, final thought]

The best way to reduce anxiety? Be genuinely prepared.

[GRAPHIC: Preparation = Confidence]

When you've:
- Built your STAR story bank
- Practiced the top 10 questions
- Researched the company
- Set up your tech (for video)

...you're not pretending to be confident. You actually have reason to be.

Preparation doesn't eliminate nerves — but it gives you something solid to fall back on.
