[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

These 10 questions appear in nearly every interview.

If you prepare for these, you're 80% ready. I'm not going to give you scripts to memorize — I'm going to give you frameworks for thinking about each one.

Let's make sure you're never caught off guard again.

## OBJECTIVES (0:30-0:45)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Know the 10 most common interview questions
- Have a framework for answering each
- Avoid the common pitfalls for each question

---

## QUESTION 1: Tell Me About Yourself (0:45-2:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, first question]

This is usually the opening question. It sets the tone.

[GRAPHIC: Framework — Present + Past + Future]

**Framework:** Your elevator pitch + why this role

**Structure:**
1. Who you are now (education, current focus)
2. Relevant background (experience, skills)
3. Why you're here (interest in this role/company)

[GRAPHIC: Example]

"I'm a business administration student at Saint Paul College graduating this May. I've spent the last two years developing customer service and problem-solving skills through my work at Target, where I've handled high-volume operations and trained new team members. I'm now looking to apply those skills in a marketing role, which is why I was excited to see this opening at [Company] — your focus on customer-centric marketing really resonates with me."

[GRAPHIC: Pitfall]

**Pitfall:** Don't give your life story. Keep it under 90 seconds.

---

## QUESTION 2: Why This Role/Company? (2:00-3:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, motivation question]

They want to know: Did you do your homework? Do you actually want THIS job or just ANY job?

[GRAPHIC: Framework — Research + Genuine interest]

**Framework:** Specific research + personal connection

**Structure:**
1. What you know about them (shows research)
2. Why that appeals to you (genuine interest)
3. How you'd contribute (value you bring)

[GRAPHIC: Pitfall]

**Pitfall:** Generic answers like "I want to grow" or "It seems like a good company." Be specific.

---

## QUESTION 3: Greatest Strength (3:00-4:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, strengths]

Pick ONE strength that's relevant to the role and back it with evidence.

[GRAPHIC: Framework — Strength + Evidence]

**Structure:**
1. Name the strength
2. Give an example proving you have it
3. Connect it to the role

[GRAPHIC: Example]

"My greatest strength is problem-solving under pressure. At my retail job, when our inventory system crashed on Black Friday, I quickly developed a manual tracking workaround that kept our department running while IT fixed the issue. That ability to stay calm and find solutions would be valuable in this fast-paced environment."

[GRAPHIC: Pitfall]

**Pitfall:** Vague strengths without proof. "I'm a hard worker" — prove it.

---

## QUESTION 4: Greatest Weakness (4:00-5:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, the tricky one]

This is not a trick question. They want self-awareness and growth mindset.

[GRAPHIC: Framework — Real weakness + What you're doing about it]

**Structure:**
1. Name a real (but not fatal) weakness
2. Give a specific example
3. Explain what you're doing to improve

[GRAPHIC: Good example]

"I sometimes take on too much myself instead of delegating. In a group project last semester, I tried to do everything and nearly burned out. I've since learned to trust teammates more and focus on what I do best. I now actively practice letting go of tasks others can handle."

[GRAPHIC: Bad examples]

**Don't say:**
- "I'm a perfectionist" (cliché, fake)
- "I work too hard" (no one believes this)
- A weakness that's fatal to the role ("I'm terrible with deadlines" for a project manager role)

---

## QUESTION 5: Where Do You See Yourself in 5 Years? (5:30-6:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, future question]

They want to know: Will you stay? Are you ambitious? Are you realistic?

[GRAPHIC: Framework — Growth + Commitment]

**Structure:**
1. Show ambition (you want to grow)
2. Show commitment (you plan to grow HERE)
3. Be realistic (not "running the company in 2 years")

[GRAPHIC: Example]

"In five years, I see myself having grown significantly in my marketing skills — ideally into a senior or lead role. I want to build deep expertise and take on increasing responsibility. What excites me about this company is the growth opportunities I've read about, and I'd love to build a long-term career here."

---

## QUESTION 6: Why Should We Hire You? (6:30-7:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, value proposition]

This is your chance to summarize your value.

[GRAPHIC: Framework — Match + Differentiator]

**Structure:**
1. What you bring that matches their needs
2. What makes you different from other candidates
3. Your genuine interest

[GRAPHIC: Example]

"You should hire me because I combine strong customer service skills with genuine curiosity about marketing. My experience handling 200+ customer interactions per day has given me insights into what customers actually want. Plus, I'm eager to learn and grow — I've already taught myself Google Analytics to prepare for this field."

---

## QUESTION 7-8: Behavioral Questions (7:30-9:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, STAR territory]

Questions like:
- "Tell me about a challenge you overcame"
- "Describe a time you worked on a team"

[GRAPHIC: Framework — STAR]

You know this one! Use your story bank.

**Structure:** Situation → Task → Action → Result

**Key reminders:**
- Pick the right story from your bank
- Emphasize the part that matches the question
- Keep it under 2.5 minutes

---

## QUESTION 9: What Questions Do You Have For Us? (9:00-10:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, your turn]

Never say "no, I think you covered everything." Always have questions.

[GRAPHIC: Good question categories]

**Good questions:**
- About the role: "What does success look like in the first 90 days?"
- About the team: "Can you tell me about the team I'd be working with?"
- About growth: "What opportunities are there for learning and development?"
- About them: "What do you enjoy most about working here?"

[GRAPHIC: Avoid]

**Avoid asking about:**
- Salary (not yet — wait for the offer)
- Time off or benefits (seems like you're already planning to not work)
- Things you could have Googled ("What does this company do?")

[GRAPHIC: How many]

Prepare 3-5 questions. You may only get to ask 2-3.

---

## QUESTION 10: Salary Expectations (10:30-12:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, money talk]

This one feels scary, but there's a formula.

[GRAPHIC: Framework — Research + Range]

**Structure:**
1. Show you've done research
2. Give a range (not a single number)
3. Express flexibility

[GRAPHIC: Example]

"Based on my research of similar roles in this area, I'm looking at the range of $40,000 to $48,000. Of course, I'm open to discussing this further based on the full compensation package and growth opportunities."

[GRAPHIC: How to research]

**Where to research:**
- Glassdoor salary data
- LinkedIn Salary Insights
- Bureau of Labor Statistics
- Ask your career center

We'll cover this more in Module 5 (Money Moves).
