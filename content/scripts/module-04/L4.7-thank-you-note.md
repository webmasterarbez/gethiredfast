**Duration:** 6 minutes (~900 words)
**Type:** Video Lesson (Demonstration)

## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Only 24% of candidates send thank-you notes after interviews.

That means if you send a good one, you immediately stand out from 76% of your competition.

And it takes about 5 minutes. Let me show you how.

## OBJECTIVES (0:30-0:45)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Know when and how to send thank-you notes
- Personalize notes for each interviewer
- Use follow-up to stay top-of-mind

## SECTION 1: The 24-Hour Rule (0:45-1:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, timing is everything]

Send your thank-you within 24 hours of the interview. Same day is even better.

[GRAPHIC: Timing matters]

**Why timing matters:**
- Shows you're prompt and professional
- Keeps you fresh in their mind while they're making decisions
- Demonstrates genuine enthusiasm

**Email vs. Handwritten:**
- Email: Almost always the right choice (faster, expected)
- Handwritten: Only if the culture is very traditional or you want to stand out for a senior role

[VISUAL: Cat, practical note]

For most entry-level positions, email is perfect. Send it within hours of the interview if possible.

## SECTION 2: The Thank-You Structure (1:30-3:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, the template]

Here's the structure that works:

[GRAPHIC: Thank-you structure]

**1. Thank them for their time**
Genuine appreciation for meeting with you.

**2. Reference something specific from the conversation**
Shows you were paying attention and it wasn't generic.

**3. Reinforce your interest and fit**
Brief reminder of why you're a good match.

**4. Address any concerns (if relevant)**
If you felt you answered something poorly or they expressed a concern, briefly address it.

**5. Next steps and enthusiasm**
Express excitement about moving forward.

Subject: Thank you — Marketing Coordinator Interview

Dear Ms. Johnson,

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today about the Marketing Coordinator position at Acme Co.

I especially enjoyed our conversation about the new social media strategy you're implementing. Your insight about prioritizing TikTok for the younger demographic really resonated with me — it aligns with the research I've been doing on Gen Z marketing trends.

Our discussion reinforced my enthusiasm for this role. I believe my customer service experience combined with my passion for digital marketing would allow me to contribute meaningfully to your team's goals.

I'm very excited about the opportunity to join Acme Co. and look forward to hearing from you about next steps. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need any additional information.

Thank you again for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Maya Chen

## SECTION 3: Multiple Interviewers (3:30-4:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, handling panels]

If you interviewed with multiple people, send individual notes to each.

[GRAPHIC: Personalization strategy]

**How to personalize:**
- Reference something each person specifically said or asked
- Slight variation in the opening and middle
- Same overall structure

**Example variation:**

For Person 1: "I particularly enjoyed our discussion about the team's upcoming product launch..."

For Person 2: "Your perspective on cross-departmental collaboration gave me great insight into the company culture..."

[VISUAL: Cat, getting contact info]

**If you don't have their emails:**
- Ask the recruiter or HR contact
- LinkedIn message (less formal but works)
- Send one note to your main contact asking them to pass along your thanks

---

## SECTION 4: Following Up After (4:30-5:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, beyond the thank-you]

The thank-you is immediate. What about after that?

[GRAPHIC: Follow-up timeline]

**If they gave you a timeline:**
Wait until after that date, then send a polite check-in.

**If you haven't heard back in 1-2 weeks:**

```
Subject: Following up — Marketing Coordinator role

Dear Ms. Johnson,

I wanted to follow up on my application for the Marketing Coordinator position. I remain very interested in the opportunity and would be happy to provide any additional information.

I understand you may still be in the decision process, and I appreciate your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Maya Chen
```

[VISUAL: Cat, the balance]

**The balance:**
- One follow-up after a week is fine
- Two follow-ups maximum
- After that, assume no response means no for now
- Never follow up aggressively or frequently

## SUMMARY & CTA (5:30-6:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]

Here's the thank-you plan:

[GRAPHIC: Key takeaways]

- Send within 24 hours (same day if possible)
