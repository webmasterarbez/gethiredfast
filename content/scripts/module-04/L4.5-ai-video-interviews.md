## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

More and more companies are using AI video interviews for initial screening.

You record answers to prompts. Software analyzes your responses. Creepy? Maybe. Common? Absolutely.

Let me show you how to succeed when you're talking to a camera instead of a person.

## OBJECTIVES (0:30-0:45)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Set up your space for video interviews
- Know what AI systems actually analyze
- Practice with the one-way video format

## SECTION 1: What Are AI Video Interviews? (0:45-2:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, explaining the format]

AI video interviews — sometimes called one-way or asynchronous interviews — work like this:

[GRAPHIC: How it works — step by step]

1. You receive an email with a link
2. You log in and see questions (text or video prompt)
3. You get limited time to prepare (often 30-60 seconds)
4. You record your answer (1-3 minutes typically)
5. You can't re-record (in most cases)
6. AI and/or humans review your responses

[VISUAL: Cat, who uses them]

**Who uses them?**
- Large companies (Target, Walmart, Unilever, Goldman Sachs)
- Companies with high application volume
- Entry-level and internship roles especially

**Common platforms:**
- HireVue (most popular)
- Modern Hire
- Spark Hire
- myInterview

[VISUAL: Cat, the reality]

This format can feel unnatural. You're talking to a camera, not a person. There's no feedback, no nodding, no reactions. But with practice, you can nail it.

## SECTION 2: Technical Setup (2:30-5:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, transitioning to demo]

Let me show you how to set up your space.

[SCREENCAST/DEMO: Setting up interview space]

[GRAPHIC: Camera position]

**Camera:**
- Eye level or slightly above
- You should be centered in the frame
- Head and shoulders visible (not too close, not too far)
- Stable — use a tripod or prop your phone/laptop

[GRAPHIC: Lighting]

**Lighting:**
- Face a window or light source (light on your face, not behind you)
- No harsh shadows
- Avoid overhead lighting that creates shadows under eyes
- Test it: if your face is bright and clear, you're good

[GRAPHIC: Background]

**Background:**
- Plain and uncluttered
- No beds, messy rooms, or distracting posters
- Neutral wall or professional setting
- Nothing that could distract or raise questions

[GRAPHIC: Audio]

**Audio:**
- Quiet space — no background noise
- Test your microphone before
- Use earbuds if your computer mic has issues
- Close windows, turn off fans, silence phones

[GRAPHIC: Tech check]

**Before the interview:**
- Test your internet connection
- Close unnecessary browser tabs and apps
- Plug in your laptop (don't run on battery)
- Do a practice recording to check everything

[VISUAL: Cat, showing setup]

[ACTION: Show Cat's own setup as example]

See my setup? Clean background, good lighting on my face, camera at eye level, quiet room. This is what you're aiming for.

## SECTION 3: What AI Analyzes (5:00-7:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the AI element]

What are these AI systems actually looking at?

[GRAPHIC: What AI analyzes]

**Confirmed factors:**
- Keywords and content of your answers
- Completion of all questions
- Technical quality (audio, video)

**Possible factors (varies by platform):**
- Tone and energy in your voice
- Eye contact with camera
- Word choice and vocabulary
- Speaking pace and clarity

[VISUAL: Cat, the controversy]

I'll be honest: there's debate about how much AI actually matters versus human reviewers. Some of these systems have been criticized for bias.

But here's what you can control:

[GRAPHIC: What you can control]

- Give complete, structured answers (STAR for behavioral)
- Use keywords from the job description
- Speak clearly and at a reasonable pace
- Look at the camera (simulates eye contact)
- Show energy and enthusiasm in your voice

[VISUAL: Cat, the strategy]

Assume a human will also watch. Make your answers good for both.

## SECTION 4: The One-Way Format (7:00-9:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, specific tips]

Here's what makes one-way interviews different and how to handle it:

[GRAPHIC: Challenge 1]

**Challenge: No feedback**
You're talking into a void. No nodding, no "uh-huh," no reactions.

**Solution:** Imagine you're talking to a friendly person just behind the camera. Pretend they're engaged, even if you can't see them.

[GRAPHIC: Challenge 2]

**Challenge: Limited prep time**
Often 30-60 seconds to prepare before recording.

**Solution:** Have your STAR stories ready. Know your key points. Use the prep time to outline, not script.

[GRAPHIC: Challenge 3]

**Challenge: Can't re-record**
Most platforms don't let you redo answers.

**Solution:** Practice the format beforehand. Many companies offer practice rounds — ALWAYS do them.

[GRAPHIC: Challenge 4]

**Challenge: Talking to a camera**
It feels weird. You instinctively look at the screen, but you should look at the camera.

**Solution:** Put a sticky note with a smiley face next to your camera lens. Look at that, not the screen.

[VISUAL: Cat, pro tip]

Practice recording yourself answering questions. Watch it back. Get used to how you look and sound on camera.

## SECTION 5: Practice Demo (9:00-11:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, live demo]

Let me show you what good looks like.

[SCREENCAST: Cat recording a practice answer]

**Prompt:** "Tell me about a time you solved a problem at work."

[ACTION: Cat demonstrates looking at camera, good energy, structured answer]

"In my retail position at Target, we had a situation during the holiday season where our department's main scanner system crashed during peak hours. As the team lead that shift, I quickly developed a workaround using the backup handheld devices and created a simple tracking sheet so we didn't lose inventory accuracy. I communicated the plan to my team within minutes and coordinated with the adjacent department to share their equipment during their slower moments. We maintained our checkout efficiency and didn't have to close any registers. The supervisor later adopted my workaround as the official backup procedure."

[VISUAL: Cat, after demo]

Notice: I looked at the camera. I used STAR structure. I spoke clearly and with energy. About 45 seconds — concise and complete.

## SECTION 6: Your Practice Assignment (11:00-12:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, call to action]

Before you face a real AI interview, practice:

[GRAPHIC: Practice steps]

1. Set up your interview space (lighting, camera, background)
2. Record yourself answering 3 practice questions
3. Watch the recordings — check for:
   - Eye contact with camera
   - Audio clarity
   - Background distractions
   - Energy and pace
4. Adjust and re-record until comfortable

[GRAPHIC: Practice questions]

**Try these:**
- "Tell me about yourself"
- "Describe a challenge you overcame"
- "Why are you interested in this role?"

[VISUAL: Cat, final tip]

The first time you do a one-way interview should NOT be the real one. Practice until the format feels natural.
