## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

"Tell me about a time when..."

You're going to hear this a lot. These behavioral questions are the most common interview format, and there's a formula that works every single time.

It's called STAR. And by the end of this lesson, you'll have it mastered.

## SECTION 1: What Is STAR? (0:45-2:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, teaching the framework]

STAR is an acronym for the four parts of a great interview answer:

[GRAPHIC: STAR breakdown — animated]

**S — Situation**
Set the scene. Where were you? What was happening? Give context, but keep it brief.

**T — Task**
What was your specific responsibility? What were you trying to accomplish?

**A — Action**
What did YOU specifically do? This is the longest and most important part.

**R — Result**
What happened? What was the outcome? Quantify if possible.

[VISUAL: Cat, time allocation]

Here's how to allocate time in a 2-minute answer:

[GRAPHIC: Pie chart]
- Situation: 15-20 seconds
- Task: 10-15 seconds
- Action: 60-90 seconds (the star of STAR)
- Result: 20-30 seconds

[VISUAL: Cat, key insight]

Notice that Action gets the most time. That's where you show what YOU did — not your team, not your manager, YOU.

---

## SECTION 2: Demo — Teamwork Question (2:30-5:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, demonstration mode]

Let me show you STAR in action.

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you worked effectively on a team."

[GRAPHIC: S appears]

**Situation:**
"Last fall, I was part of a 4-person team in my marketing class. We were assigned to create a marketing plan for a real local coffee shop. Two weeks before the deadline, one of our team members dropped the class."

[VISUAL: Cat, pointing out]

Notice: specific, brief, sets up the challenge.

[GRAPHIC: T appears]

**Task:**
"As the project lead, I needed to redistribute the work, keep us on schedule, and make sure we delivered a quality product to the client."

[VISUAL: Cat, pointing out]

Notice: I said MY role, not "we had to."

[GRAPHIC: A appears]

**Action:**
"I immediately called an emergency meeting. We listed all remaining tasks and assessed each person's strengths. I took on the competitive analysis myself since I had the most research experience. I created a compressed timeline with daily check-ins. I set up a shared document so we could see each other's progress in real-time. I also reached out to the coffee shop owner to reset expectations on our timeline. Throughout the project, I checked in each evening to review what everyone submitted and provided feedback for next-day improvements."

[VISUAL: Cat, pointing out]

Notice: Every sentence starts with "I." Multiple specific actions. This is the longest part.

[GRAPHIC: R appears]

**Result:**
"We delivered on time with a 30-page marketing plan. We received the highest grade in the class — a 98. The coffee shop owner implemented three of our five recommendations, including our social media strategy. And the professor used our project as an example for future classes."

[VISUAL: Cat, pointing out]

Notice: Quantified where possible. Multiple types of results — grade, client impact, recognition.

[GRAPHIC: Full story complete — timing]

**Total time:** About 2 minutes. Perfect.

## SECTION 3: Demo — Challenge Question (5:30-8:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, second example]

Let's do another one.

**Question:** "Tell me about a challenge you overcame."

[GRAPHIC: Building the answer]

**S:** "Last year, my family had a financial emergency. My mom's hours got cut, and I needed to increase my income while maintaining my full course load and keeping my GPA up for my scholarship."

**T:** "I needed to work at least 30 hours a week — up from 20 — while taking 15 credits and maintaining a 3.2 GPA minimum."

**A:** "First, I negotiated with my manager for a flexible schedule that worked around my classes — she was supportive when I explained the situation honestly. Then I completely restructured my week using time-blocking. Every hour had a purpose — work, class, study, or sleep. I identified my hardest class and formed a study group so we could teach each other and be more efficient. I also visited each of my professors during office hours to let them know my situation — not for special treatment, but so they knew I was committed. And I cut out all distractions — late-night gaming, social scrolling — anything that wasn't moving me forward."

**R:** "I worked 32 hours a week on average and finished the semester with a 3.4 GPA — actually higher than before. I got promoted to shift lead at work. And I learned time management skills I still use every day."

[VISUAL: Cat, the insight]

This story shows resilience, problem-solving, communication, self-management. One story, many demonstrated skills.

## SECTION 4: Common Mistakes (8:00-10:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, cautionary]

Let me tell you what ruins STAR answers:

[GRAPHIC: Mistake 1]

**Mistake 1: Too much Situation, not enough Action**
"So there was this project, and the professor assigned groups, and our group had five people, and one person never showed up to meetings, and another person was always late, and the deadline was in two weeks..."

By minute 2, I still don't know what YOU did. Cut the setup.

[GRAPHIC: Mistake 2]

**Mistake 2: "We" instead of "I"**
"We worked together." "We figured it out."

I'm hiring YOU, not your team. What did YOU specifically contribute?

[GRAPHIC: Mistake 3]

**Mistake 3: No Result or weak Result**
"And then the project was done."

That's not a result. What happened? What changed? What was the outcome? What did you learn?

[GRAPHIC: Mistake 4]

**Mistake 4: Too long**
If your answer is over 3 minutes, it's too long. The interviewer's eyes are glazing over. Practice being concise.

[GRAPHIC: Mistake 5]

**Mistake 5: Memorized word-for-word**
If you've memorized a script and recite it like a robot, it sounds fake. Know the structure and key points, but speak naturally.

## SECTION 5: The Adaptation Trick (10:30-12:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, pro tip]

Here's a powerful secret: one strong STAR story can answer many different questions.

[GRAPHIC: Story adaptation]

Take the marketing project story. The same story can answer:
- "Tell me about a time you worked on a team"
- "Describe a challenge you overcame"
- "Tell me about a time you led a project"
- "Describe a time you had to meet a deadline"
- "Tell me about your experience with clients"

[VISUAL: Cat, how to adapt]

The difference is which part you emphasize:
- For teamwork: emphasize the coordination and collaboration
- For challenge: emphasize the dropped team member crisis
- For leadership: emphasize your decision-making and direction
- For deadline: emphasize the compressed timeline

[VISUAL: Cat, the implication]

This is why you don't need 50 stories. You need 5-6 really strong ones that you can adapt.

## SECTION 6: Your Turn (12:00-14:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, practice time]

Before we move on, I want you to try one.

[GRAPHIC: Exercise]

Think of a time you:
- Helped solve a problem
- Worked with others
- Took initiative
- Learned something new

[GRAPHIC: Pause indicator]

Now, out loud, tell that story in STAR format:
- S: Set the scene (15-20 seconds)
- T: Your responsibility (10-15 seconds)
- A: What YOU did (60-90 seconds)
- R: The outcome (20-30 seconds)

Time yourself. Aim for 2 minutes or less.

[VISUAL: Cat, after pause]

Did it feel awkward? Good. That's how it should feel at first. In the next lesson, you'll build a full story bank and practice until it's natural.
