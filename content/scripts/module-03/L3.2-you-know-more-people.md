**Module:** 03 - Network Navigator
**Duration:** 12 minutes (~1800 words)
**Type:** Video Lesson (Demonstration)

## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

"I don't know anyone."

When students tell me this, I ask them: Do you have family? Friends? Classmates? A dentist? A former teacher?

That's your network.

By the end of this lesson, you're going to have at least 50 names on your network list. Let me prove it.

## OBJECTIVES (0:45-1:00)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Identify 50+ people in your existing network
- Understand why "weak ties" are often most valuable
- See connections you didn't realize you had

## SECTION 1: Expanding the Definition (1:00-3:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, redefining "network"]

When most people think "network," they imagine professionals in suits exchanging business cards.

That's way too narrow.

[GRAPHIC: Expanded network definition]

Your network is everyone you've ever had a positive interaction with who might remember you.

[VISUAL: Cat, categories]

That includes:

**Inner Circle**
- Parents, siblings, close family
- Best friends
- Mentors

**Extended Circle**
- Aunts, uncles, cousins
- Family friends
- Neighbors

**Academic Circle**
- Current classmates
- Former classmates (high school, other colleges)
- Professors, advisors, tutors

**Work Circle**
- Current coworkers
- Former coworkers
- Former bosses
- Regular customers you know

**Community Circle**
- Church/mosque/temple members
- Club members
- Sports teammates
- Volunteer groups

**Online Circle**
- LinkedIn connections
- Online communities
- Discord servers, hobby forums

[VISUAL: Cat, the realization]

When you start thinking this way, suddenly you have hundreds of potential connections.

## SECTION 2: The Power of Weak Ties (3:00-5:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, counterintuitive insight]

Here's something surprising from research: your weak ties are often more valuable than your close friends.

[GRAPHIC: Granovetter's weak ties research]

Sociologist Mark Granovetter studied how people found jobs. He expected to find that close friends helped most. Instead, he found that acquaintances — weak ties — were more helpful.

[VISUAL: Cat, why]

Why? Your close friends know the same people and information you do. But your acquaintance from that summer job? They move in completely different circles. They know about opportunities you've never heard of.

[GRAPHIC: Weak tie examples]

**Weak ties that could help:**
- Your parent's coworker
- Your high school classmate you haven't talked to in years
- Your former boss's former boss
- Your professor's grad students
- Your neighbor who works at that company you're interested in

[VISUAL: Cat, implication]

Don't discount people just because you're not close. Those distant connections are often your best leads.

## SECTION 3: The Network Circle Demo (5:00-8:00)

[VISUAL: Cat transitioning to demonstration]

Let me show you how to map this out.

[GRAPHIC/SCREENCAST: Network circle template]

[ACTION: Draw concentric circles]

I like to use concentric circles. The center is you. Each ring is a different category.

[ACTION: Start with inner circle]

**Inner circle — closest connections (5-10 people):**
- Parents: John, Maria
- Siblings: Jake
- Best friends: Sam, Aisha
- Mentor: Professor Thompson

[ACTION: Move to extended circle]

**Extended circle — family and neighbors (15-20 people):**
- Aunt Linda, Uncle Marcus
- Cousin Tyler (works in marketing!)
- Family friends: The Johnsons, the Garcias
- Neighbors: Mr. Williams (retired HR)

[ACTION: Academic circle]

**Academic — school connections (20-30 people):**
- Current classmates: Maria, Devon, Jasmine, Marcus, Lisa...
- Former classmates: Think about group project partners, study groups
- Professors: Ms. Chen, Mr. Roberts
- Advisor: Dr. Williams
- Tutors, TAs, career center staff

[ACTION: Work circle]

**Work — professional connections (10-20 people):**
- Current job: manager Sarah, coworkers Mike, Deja, Tyler
- Former job at Starbucks: manager Jen, coworker Marcus
- Regular customers you know by name

[ACTION: Community circle]

**Community — groups and activities (10-20 people):**
- Church group
- Volunteer activities
- Sports teams
- Clubs

[ACTION: Online circle]

**Online — digital connections (varies):**
- LinkedIn connections
- People you've engaged with in professional groups

[VISUAL: Cat, stepping back]

Look at that. I just rattled off categories, and we're easily over 50 people.

Your list will look different. But the principle is the same — you know more people than you think.

## SECTION 4: Second-Degree Connections (8:00-10:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, multiplying the network]

Now let's talk about second-degree connections — people your connections know.

[GRAPHIC: You → Your connection → Their connections]

You might not know anyone at your dream company. But does your aunt? Does your professor? Does your former coworker?

[VISUAL: Cat, how to find out]

Here's how to discover second-degree connections:

[GRAPHIC: LinkedIn feature]

**LinkedIn:** Go to a company page. Click "People." It'll show you who in your network is connected to people there. That's your in.

[GRAPHIC: Ask strategy]

**Ask directly:** "Hey Uncle Marcus, do you know anyone who works in marketing? I'm trying to learn more about the field."

[VISUAL: Cat, the power]

One student I worked with didn't know anyone in tech. But she mentioned she was job searching at Thanksgiving. Her cousin's boyfriend worked at a startup and referred her for an internship.

That's the hidden job market in action. The opportunity came from a connection she didn't even know she had.

## SECTION 5: Your Assignment (10:00-11:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, activation]

In the next lesson, you're going to do this exercise yourself — in detail.

[GRAPHIC: Prep for next lesson]

Before you move on, I want you to do this:

**Quick brainstorm (5 minutes):**
1. Grab a piece of paper
2. Write down every person you can think of in 5 minutes
3. Don't filter — just names
4. Count them at the end

[VISUAL: Cat, what to expect]

Most students end up with 30-50 names just from the quick brainstorm. When they do the full exercise, they get to 50-100.

The point is to prove to yourself: you have a network. It exists. Now we're going to use it.

## SUMMARY & CTA (11:30-12:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]

Here's what you've learned:

[GRAPHIC: Key takeaways]

- Your network is everyone you've had positive contact with
- Weak ties (acquaintances) are often more valuable than close friends
- Second-degree connections (people who know people) multiply your reach
- You have more connections than you realized

[GRAPHIC: "Next: Network Mapping Exercise"]

Next up: the full Network Mapping Exercise. You'll identify 50+ contacts, categorize them, and pick your top 10 to reach out to first.

[GRAPHIC: Download reminder]

Download the Network Circle Template. You'll use it in the next lesson.

[VISUAL: Cat, encouraging]

"I don't know anyone" ends today. Let's map your network.
