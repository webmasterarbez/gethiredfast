## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Informational interviews are the most underused career strategy.

Most people won't do them because they feel awkward. That's your advantage — the few who do stand out.

Today I'll show you how to request, prepare for, and crush an informational interview.

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Request informational interviews professionally
- Know exactly what questions to ask
- Follow up to build lasting relationships

## SECTION 1: What It Is (and Isn't) (1:00-2:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, clarifying]

Let's be clear about what an informational interview is.

[GRAPHIC: What it IS]

**An informational interview IS:**
- A conversation to learn about someone's career/industry
- Typically 15-20 minutes (respect their time)
- You asking questions, them sharing insights
- Relationship building

[GRAPHIC: What it is NOT]

**An informational interview is NOT:**
- A job interview
- Asking for a job
- Pitching yourself
- Begging

[VISUAL: Cat, the key rule]

**Critical rule: Never ask for a job in an informational interview.**

Ask for advice. Ask for insights. Ask for their story.

Jobs often come later — organically — from the relationship you build. But if you ask for a job, you've broken the social contract and they'll feel used.

## SECTION 2: How to Request One (2:30-4:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the ask]

You already have outreach scripts from the last lesson. Here's the specific informational interview request:

[GRAPHIC: Request template]

**Email/LinkedIn message:**

```
Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], a [major] student at [School] exploring
careers in [field]. I came across your profile and was
impressed by your experience at [Company].

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call? I'd love to
learn about your career path and any advice you have
for someone starting out.

I'm flexible on timing and happy to work around your
schedule. Thank you for considering!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

[VISUAL: Cat, what makes it work]

Notice:
- Specific about who you are and why them
- Small ask (15 minutes)
- Flexible
- Grateful

---

## SECTION 3: Questions to Ask (4:00-7:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, preparation]

The person said yes. Now what do you ask?

[GRAPHIC: Question categories]

**About their journey:**
- How did you get into this field?
- What was your first job out of school?
- What's been the most surprising thing about your career?

**About the day-to-day:**
- What does a typical day or week look like?
- What's the most challenging part of your role?
- What do you enjoy most?

**About the industry:**
- What skills are most important for someone starting out?
- What do you wish you'd known when you were in my position?
- What trends do you see shaping the field?

**About opportunities:**
- How do people typically break into this field?
- Are there any companies you'd recommend for someone starting out?
- Is there anyone else you'd suggest I talk to?

[VISUAL: Cat, the magic question]

**The magic closing question:**
"Is there anyone else you'd recommend I talk to?"

This one question can multiply your network exponentially. Many people are happy to make introductions.

[GRAPHIC: Question limits]

**Questions to AVOID:**
- "Do you have any job openings?"
- "Can you get me an interview?"
- "What's your salary?"
- Anything that puts them on the spot

## SECTION 4: The 15-Minute Structure (7:00-8:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, the meeting itself]

Here's how to structure the actual conversation:

[GRAPHIC: 15-minute structure]

**0:00-1:00 — Warm-up**
Thank them for their time. Brief intro of yourself (30 seconds max).

**1:00-12:00 — Questions**
Ask your prepared questions. Listen more than you talk. Take notes.

**12:00-14:00 — Their questions**
They might ask about you. Be ready with your elevator pitch.

**14:00-15:00 — Close**
Thank them sincerely. Ask the magic question (who else to talk to). Confirm how to follow up.

[VISUAL: Cat, practical tips]

**Tips:**
- Have questions written down — it's expected
- It's okay to take notes
- Don't go over time unless they extend it
- Be engaged and curious

---

## SECTION 5: Follow Up (8:30-9:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, after the meeting]

The follow-up is where relationships are built.

[GRAPHIC: Follow-up template]

**Within 24 hours, send a thank-you:**

```
Subject: Thank you — really appreciated our conversation

Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for taking the time to chat with me
today. Your insights about [specific thing they said]
were really helpful.

I'm going to [specific action based on their advice].

If I can ever be helpful to you in any way, please
don't hesitate to reach out. I hope we can stay in touch!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

[VISUAL: Cat, staying in touch]

**For ongoing relationship:**
- Connect on LinkedIn if you haven't
- Follow up in 3-6 months with an update
- Share relevant articles occasionally
- Let them know when you land a job

[GRAPHIC: The long game]

Informational interviews aren't about immediate results. They're about building relationships that pay off over time.

---

## SECTION 6: Your Assignment (9:30-10:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, call to action]

Here's what I want you to do:

[GRAPHIC: Assignment]

**This week: Send 3 informational interview requests.**

Use your network map. Pick 3 people who work in or near your target field. Send the request.

Even if only 1 says yes, that's 1 conversation, 1 relationship, and potentially multiple referrals.

[VISUAL: Cat, the numbers]

The math: If you send 10 requests, maybe 3 say yes. Those 3 might introduce you to 2 more people each. Now you have 9 conversations. One of those might lead to a job.

That's how the hidden job market works.
