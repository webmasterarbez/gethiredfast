## SETUP (0:45-1:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, preparation]

Before we start, get these ready:

[GRAPHIC: What you need]

1. **Network Map Worksheet** (download it if you haven't)
2. **A quiet 15-20 minutes**
3. **Your phone** (for scrolling contacts, social media, LinkedIn)
4. **Open mind** (don't filter — write everyone down)

[VISUAL: Cat, instruction]

This exercise works best when you just brainstorm without judging. Write everyone down first. Filter later.

Ready? Let's go category by category.

## SECTION 1: Inner Circle (1:30-3:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, first category]

**Close Family:**
Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins you're close to.

**Best Friends:**
The 3-5 people you talk to most.

Now let's expand — people you know but aren't closest to.

Cousins you don't see often, in-laws, second cousins, family friends.

**Neighbors:**
Current and former. That neighbor who works at the hospital? Write them down.

## SECTION 6: Count and Assess (11:00-12:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, assessment time]

Alright, stop and count.

[GRAPHIC: Count checkpoint]

**How many names do you have?**

- 30-40: Good start. Keep thinking.
- 50-60: Solid network. You're doing great.
- 70+: You're more connected than you thought!

[VISUAL: Cat, if you're short]

If you're under 50, go back through each category:
- Did you forget anyone from high school?
- What about that summer job 3 years ago?
- Family friends your parents mention?
- People you follow on LinkedIn?

[VISUAL: Cat, categorize relevance]

Now, for each person, think about:

**1. Relationship strength (1-3)**
- 3 = We're close, they'd respond
- 2 = We're friendly, probably respond
- 1 = We know each other, might respond

**2. Career relevance (1-3)**
- 3 = Works in or knows people in my target field
- 2 = Professional, could make introductions
- 1 = Not professionally connected but supportive

---

## SECTION 7: Identify Your Top 10 (12:30-14:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, prioritization]

Now let's identify who to reach out to first.

[GRAPHIC: Top 10 criteria]

Look for people who score high on:
- Relationship (they'd respond to you)
- Relevance (they could help with your target roles)
- Accessibility (you have their contact info)

[VISUAL: Cat, example selection]

My top 10 might look like:
1. Uncle Marcus — works in business, well-connected (strength: 3, relevance: 3)
2. Professor Chen — marketing, knows industry people (3, 3)
3. Former manager Jen — might have connections (2, 2)
4. Cousin Tyler — works in marketing! (3, 3)
5. Career center Jamie — job of connecting students (2, 3)
6. Classmate Maria — graduating same time, we can share leads (3, 2)
...and so on.

[GRAPHIC: Action plan]

Pick your top 10. These are the first people you'll reach out to.

[VISUAL: Cat, next step]

In the next lesson, I'll give you exact scripts for reaching out to these people. You won't have to figure out what to say.

## SUMMARY & CTA (14:00-15:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]

Here's what you just created:

[GRAPHIC: Deliverable complete]

**Deliverable: Network Map (50+ contacts)** ✓

- All your connections organized by category

[VISUAL: Cat, the power]

This map is a living document. Add to it as you meet new people. Update it as relationships grow.

[GRAPHIC: "Next: What to Say"]

Next lesson: Networking Scripts. I'm going to give you the exact words to use when reaching out. No more wondering what to say.

[GRAPHIC: Log your win]

Log it in your tracker: "Network map complete — 50+ contacts identified."

You just went from "I don't know anyone" to having a list of 50+ connections. That's progress.
