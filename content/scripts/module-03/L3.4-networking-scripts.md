# L3.4: What to Say — Networking Scripts

**Module:** 03 - Network Navigator
**Duration:** 12 minutes (~1800 words)
**Type:** Video Lesson (Demonstration)

---

## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

The #1 reason people don't network? They don't know what to say.

You know you should reach out. You have a list of contacts. But you stare at the blank message and freeze.

That ends now. I'm giving you the exact words. Copy-paste ready. Customize and send.

## OBJECTIVES (0:45-1:00)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Write LinkedIn connection requests that get accepted
- Draft cold emails that get responses
- Know how to follow up without being annoying

## SECTION 1: The Mindset First (1:00-2:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, setting expectations]

Before I give you the scripts, let's talk about what makes them work.

[GRAPHIC: Three principles]

**Principle 1: Be specific about why you're reaching out.**
"I'm reaching out because..." with a clear reason.

**Principle 2: Make it easy to say yes.**
Ask for something small — 15 minutes, a quick question, a connection.

**Principle 3: Be genuine.**
Customize the template. Reference something specific about them.

[VISUAL: Cat, reality check]

These scripts are starting points. A slightly awkward personalized message beats a perfect generic one.

---

## SECTION 2: LinkedIn Connection Request (2:00-4:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, first script]

Let's start with LinkedIn connection requests. You get 300 characters, so be concise.

[GRAPHIC: Script 1 — Warm connection]

**For someone you know:**
```
Hi [Name]! We met at [context — class, work, event].
I'm currently exploring opportunities in [field] and
would love to stay connected. Hope you're doing well!
```

[GRAPHIC: Script 2 — Cold connection (same school)]

**For someone at your school you don't know:**
```
Hi [Name], I'm a fellow [School Name] student
interested in [field]. I saw you work at [Company]
and would love to connect and learn about your
experience. Thanks!
```

[GRAPHIC: Script 3 — Cold connection (alumni)]

**For an alum:**
```
Hi [Name], I'm a [School Name] student graduating
in [date]. I'm interested in [field/company] and
noticed you're an alum. Would love to connect
and learn from your experience!
```

[GRAPHIC: Script 4 — Cold connection (random professional)]

**For someone you found through research:**
```
Hi [Name], I came across your profile while
researching [industry/topic]. Your work at
[Company] looks fascinating. Would love to
connect and learn more about your career path!
```

[VISUAL: Cat, pro tips]

**Pro tips:**
- Reference something specific (their company, their post, mutual connection)
- Don't ask for a job in the connection request
- Connection first, conversation second

## SECTION 3: Outreach Emails (4:00-7:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, email scripts]

When you have someone's email (or LinkedIn InMail), you have more room.

[GRAPHIC: Email template — informational interview request]

**Subject: Quick question from a [School] student**

```
Hi [Name],

My name is [Your Name], and I'm a [major] student
at [School], graduating in [date].

I found your profile on LinkedIn and was impressed
by your work at [Company]. I'm exploring careers in
[field] and would love to learn more about your
experience and any advice you might have.

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick phone call or
virtual coffee? I'm flexible on timing and happy to
work around your schedule.

Thank you for considering — I really appreciate it!

Best,
[Your Name]
[Phone] | [LinkedIn URL]
```

[VISUAL: Cat, breaking it down]

Notice the structure:
1. Who you are (brief)
2. Why you're reaching out (specific)
3. What you're asking for (small, easy to say yes)
4. Gratitude and flexibility

[GRAPHIC: Email template — warm introduction request]

**To ask someone to introduce you:**

```
Subject: Quick favor — introduction request

Hi [Name],

I hope you're doing well! I'm currently job searching
in [field] and noticed you're connected to [Person] at
[Company] on LinkedIn.

I'm really interested in [Company/role] and would love
to learn more about opportunities there. Would you be
comfortable introducing us? Happy to send you a blurb
you can forward, or however makes it easiest for you.

Totally understand if it's not a good fit — I appreciate
you even considering!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

[VISUAL: Cat, key point]

Make it easy: offer to draft the introduction for them.

## SECTION 4: Follow-Up Scripts (7:00-9:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, following up]

Most people need 2-3 touches before responding. Following up is not annoying — it's expected.

[GRAPHIC: Follow-up timing]

**Timeline:**
- Wait 5-7 days after first outreach
- Send one follow-up
- If no response after follow-up, move on (but try again in 3-6 months)

[GRAPHIC: Follow-up template]

**Follow-up email:**

```
Subject: Following up — [Original subject]

Hi [Name],

Just wanted to follow up on my message from last
week. I know you're busy, but I'd still love to
chat for 15 minutes if you have time.

If the timing isn't right, no worries at all —
I appreciate you even considering.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

[VISUAL: Cat, mindset on silence]

If you don't hear back after two attempts, don't take it personally. People are busy. They might respond months later. Or not at all. That's normal.

Move on to the next person. It's a numbers game.

---

## SECTION 5: What NOT to Do (9:00-10:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, cautionary]

Let me tell you what kills networking messages:

[GRAPHIC: Don't do this]

**Don't ask for a job directly.**
"Do you have any job openings?" → Delete.

**Don't write a novel.**
Three paragraphs max. Respect their time.

**Don't be vague.**
"I'd love to pick your brain" → About what? Be specific.

**Don't forget to follow up.**
One message and done = low response rate.

**Don't be entitled.**
"I'm sure you can help me" → No one owes you anything.

[GRAPHIC: Do this instead]

**DO:** Ask for advice, insights, or a conversation.
**DO:** Be specific about why you chose them.
**DO:** Be grateful and low-pressure.
**DO:** Follow up once.
**DO:** Accept silence gracefully.

---

## SECTION 6: Your Turn (10:30-11:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, action time]

Here's your assignment:

[GRAPHIC: Exercise]

**Write 3 outreach messages right now:**

1. One to someone in your inner circle (easy)
2. One to an acquaintance or second-degree connection (medium)
3. One to a professional you don't know but want to connect with (stretch)

Use the templates. Customize with specifics. Get them ready to send.

[GRAPHIC: Pause indicator]

Pause now and write them. Take 5-7 minutes.

[VISUAL: Cat, after pause]

Done? Good. In the next lesson, we'll cover what to do when they say yes — informational interviews.

## SUMMARY & CTA (11:30-12:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]
