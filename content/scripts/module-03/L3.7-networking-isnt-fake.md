## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

"Networking feels fake."

I hear this all the time. Students tell me they feel like they're using people, being transactional, or pretending to care when they really just want a job.

If that's how networking feels to you, you're thinking about it wrong.

Let me show you a different way.

## OBJECTIVES (0:30-0:45)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- See networking as relationship building, not transactions
- Understand how to give value even when you feel you have nothing to offer
- Feel more comfortable with networking activities

## SECTION 1: The Transactional Trap (0:45-2:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, diagnosing the problem]

Here's why networking feels fake for many people:

[GRAPHIC: Transactional mindset]

**Transactional thinking:**
"I need something from this person. I have to pretend to care about them so they'll help me."

That IS fake. And people can sense it.

[VISUAL: Cat, the alternative]

But here's the thing — that's not what good networking is.

[GRAPHIC: Relational mindset]

**Relational thinking:**
"I'm genuinely curious about this person's experience. If I build a real connection, maybe we can help each other over time."

See the difference?

Transactional: I want something now.
Relational: I'm building a relationship for the long term.

[VISUAL: Cat, the truth]

Relational networking doesn't feel fake because it isn't fake. You're genuinely interested. You're genuinely grateful. You're genuinely building connections.

## SECTION 2: What You Can Give (2:00-3:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, addressing the objection]

"But I'm a student. What do I have to offer someone with 10 years of experience?"

More than you think.

[GRAPHIC: What students can offer]

**Things you can give:**

**1. Genuine interest and attention**
Most people love talking about themselves. Being a good listener is valuable.

**2. Gratitude**
A sincere thank-you goes further than you'd expect. People remember who appreciated them.

**3. Follow-through**
If you say you'll do something, do it. That alone puts you ahead of 80% of people.

**4. Fresh perspective**
You see things differently. Your questions might spark new ideas for them.

**5. Future value**
You're building skills. Someday you might be the one who can help them — or refer someone to them.

[VISUAL: Cat, the key insight]

Networking isn't about equal exchange right now. It's about building a relationship that creates value over time — for both people.

## SECTION 3: The Give-First Approach (3:30-4:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical strategy]

Here's a mindset that makes networking feel authentic:

[GRAPHIC: Give first]

**Give before you ask.**

Before every networking interaction, ask yourself: "How can I help this person?"

[VISUAL: Cat, examples]

Maybe you:
- Share an article they'd find interesting
- Introduce them to someone they'd want to meet
- Offer to help with something small
- Just show genuine appreciation for their time

[GRAPHIC: The reciprocity effect]

When you lead with giving, something interesting happens. People naturally want to reciprocate. They're more likely to help you because you've already helped them.

This isn't manipulation — it's how healthy relationships work.

## SECTION 4: Long-Term Thinking (4:30-5:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, the bigger picture]

One more mindset shift:

[GRAPHIC: Long-term thinking]

**Think in years, not weeks.**

The connection you make today might not pay off for 2 years. That's fine. That's how relationships work.

[VISUAL: Cat, the story]

I've seen students make connections that led to jobs 18 months later. The person they met at a career fair remembered them and reached out when an opening came up.

[GRAPHIC: The practice]

**The practice:**
- Stay in touch with people periodically
- Share updates on your career
- Congratulate them on their wins
- Remember birthdays and work anniversaries

[VISUAL: Cat, reality check]

This isn't about gaming a system. It's about being a good person who maintains relationships. That's valuable in life, not just job searching.
