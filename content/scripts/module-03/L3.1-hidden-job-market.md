**Module:** 03 - Network Navigator
**Duration:** 10 minutes (~1500 words)
**Type:** Video Lesson (Instruction)

## HOOK (0:00-0:45)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Here's a stat that changes everything.

70% of jobs are never posted publicly.

They're filled through referrals, internal promotions, and networking. The jobs you see on Indeed and LinkedIn? That's only 30% of what's out there.

If you're only applying online, you're competing for a fraction of the opportunities. Today, we're going to unlock the other 70%.

## OBJECTIVES (0:45-1:00)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Understand why most jobs are filled through connections
- Know what the "hidden job market" really means
- See networking as a skill you can develop (not a personality trait)

## SECTION 1: The 70/30 Reality (1:00-3:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, data-driven explanation]

Let me break down why this 70/30 split exists.

[GRAPHIC: Why employers prefer referrals]

**Why employers prefer referrals:**

1. **Lower risk** — If someone they trust recommends you, you're pre-vetted
2. **Faster hiring** — No posting, screening, sorting through 500 applications
3. **Better retention** — Referred candidates tend to stay longer
4. **Cultural fit** — The referrer knows both parties

[VISUAL: Cat, the reality from the hiring side]

As a recruiter, when I had an opening, guess what I did first? I asked my team: "Do you know anyone good?"

If they did, I'd interview that person before posting the job. Often, I'd never need to post it at all.

[GRAPHIC: The funnel]

- Job opens
- Manager asks team for referrals
- 1-2 candidates interviewed from referrals
- Job filled before it's ever posted

[VISUAL: Cat, the implication]

That's why networking matters. You're not just applying — you're getting into the conversation before everyone else.

## SECTION 2: What "Networking" Actually Means (3:00-5:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, redefining networking]

Now, let's talk about what networking actually is — because most people have it wrong.

[GRAPHIC: What networking is NOT]

**Networking is NOT:**
- Schmoozing at fancy events with a drink in hand
- Using people for job leads
- Being fake or salesy
- Collecting business cards like Pokémon

[VISUAL: Cat, the real definition]

[GRAPHIC: What networking IS]

**Networking IS:**
- Building genuine relationships over time
- Helping others when you can
- Staying in touch with people you know
- Asking for advice and information (not jobs)
- Being a connector yourself

[VISUAL: Cat, the mindset shift]

Here's the key mindset: networking is about relationships, not transactions.

You're not asking "What can you do for me?"
You're asking "How can we help each other?"

When you build real relationships, job opportunities come naturally. People refer you because they like you and trust you, not because you asked for a favor.

## SECTION 3: Networking as a Skill (5:30-7:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, addressing the objection]

"But I'm an introvert. I'm not good at this stuff."

I hear this all the time. And I'm going to tell you something important:

[GRAPHIC: Networking = Skill, not personality]

**Networking is a skill, not a personality trait.**

Introverts can be excellent networkers. In some ways, they're better — they listen more, ask deeper questions, and build more meaningful connections.

[VISUAL: Cat, skill breakdown]

Here are the skills involved:
- Reaching out to people (you can learn scripts)
- Asking good questions (you can prepare these)
- Following up (you can set reminders)
- Staying in touch (you can build systems)

All of these can be learned. None require you to be an extrovert.

[GRAPHIC: The advantage]

In fact, most people don't network at all. It feels awkward, so they avoid it. If you just do the basics consistently, you'll be ahead of 90% of job seekers.

## SECTION 4: Where to Start (7:30-9:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical entry point]

So where do you start if "networking" sounds overwhelming?

[GRAPHIC: Start here]

**Start with who you already know.**

You don't need to cold-message CEOs or go to fancy events. You need to tap into connections you already have — and you have more than you think.

[VISUAL: Cat, examples]

Your network includes:
- Family (parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins)
- Family friends
- Current and former coworkers
- Classmates (past and present)
- Professors and advisors
- Neighbors
- People at clubs, groups, churches, activities
- LinkedIn connections

[GRAPHIC: The ripple effect]

And here's the thing: each of those people knows other people. Your aunt's coworker might work at your dream company. Your professor might know someone in your target field.

This is called second-degree networking. You don't need to know everyone — you just need to know people who know people.

## SUMMARY & CTA (9:00-10:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]

Here's what you know now:

[GRAPHIC: Key takeaways]

- 70% of jobs are filled through connections, not applications
- Networking is relationship building, not schmoozing
- It's a skill you can develop, regardless of personality
- You already have a network — you just haven't mapped it yet

[GRAPHIC: "Next: You Know More People Than You Think"]

Next lesson: I'm going to prove that you know more people than you think. We'll map your network and find 50+ connections — probably more.

[VISUAL: Cat, encouraging]

If "I don't know anyone" has been your story — that ends today.
