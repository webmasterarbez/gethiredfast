## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Your college pays for Handshake. It's literally designed to connect students like you with employers who want to hire students like you.

If you're not using it, you're leaving opportunities on the table.

Let me show you how to set it up and use it effectively.

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

- Have an optimized Handshake profile

## SECTION 1: Why Handshake (0:45-2:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, making the case]

Handshake is different from Indeed or LinkedIn. Here's why it matters for you:

[GRAPHIC: Handshake advantages]

**1. Built for students**
Employers on Handshake are specifically looking to hire students and recent grads. They expect limited experience.

**2. Your school is connected**
Employers recruit from your specific school. They've already said "yes" to students like you.

**3. Events and career fairs**
Virtual and in-person events, info sessions, and career fairs — all in one place.

**4. It's free**
Your tuition already covers access. Use it.

[VISUAL: Cat, the reality]

Many community college students don't use Handshake. That means less competition for you.

## SECTION 2: Setting Up Your Profile (2:00-4:30)

[VISUAL: Cat transitioning to screencast]

Let me walk you through setting up a strong profile.

[SCREENCAST: Handshake interface]

[ACTION: Login/access]

First, access Handshake through your college's career services page or go to joinhandshake.com and log in with your school email.

[ACTION: Profile section]

**Profile basics:**
- Photo (same rules as LinkedIn — professional headshot)
- Major, graduation date, GPA (if 3.0+)

[ACTION: Work experience]

**Work experience:**
Add all your jobs, including part-time and volunteer work. Same achievement-focused bullets you used on your resume.

[ACTION: Skills]

**Skills:**
Add relevant skills. Handshake uses these for job matching.

[ACTION: Interests]

**Job interests:**
Tell Handshake what you're looking for:
- Job types (full-time, part-time, internship)
- Industries
- Locations
- Work authorization

[ACTION: Privacy settings]

**Privacy settings:**
Make sure your profile is visible to employers. Some students accidentally make themselves invisible.

[GRAPHIC: Profile completeness]

**Goal: 100% profile completeness.** Handshake shows you your progress.

## SECTION 3: Using Handshake (4:30-6:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical usage]

Now that your profile is set up, here's how to use it:

[SCREENCAST: Handshake features]

[ACTION: Job search]

**Job search:**
Search by keyword, location, or let Handshake recommend jobs based on your profile. Filter by:
- Full-time vs. internship
- Entry-level
- Industry
- Company size

[ACTION: Saved searches and alerts]

**Set up job alerts:**
Save searches and get email notifications when matching jobs are posted. Check weekly at minimum.

[ACTION: Events]

**Events:**
Look for:
- Virtual info sessions
- Career fairs
- Employer panels
- Networking events

RSVP to events in your target field. Even virtual ones are valuable for making connections.

[ACTION: Employers]

**Follow employers:**
If there are companies you're interested in, follow them. You'll get notified when they post jobs or events.

[ACTION: Messages]

**Messages:**
Some employers message students directly. Check your Handshake inbox!

## SECTION 4: Other Platforms (6:00-7:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, platform strategy]

Handshake is great, but it's not the only platform. Here's where else to focus:

[GRAPHIC: Platform strategy]

**Primary platforms (use these consistently):**
- **Handshake** — for student-specific opportunities
- **LinkedIn** — for networking and professional brand
- **Indeed** — for broad job search

**Secondary platforms (use strategically):**
- **Google for Jobs** — aggregates from many sites
- **Glassdoor** — for company research + job listings
- **Industry-specific boards** — if applicable (e.g., Idealist for nonprofits)

[VISUAL: Cat, the warning]

**Warning: Don't spread yourself too thin.**

It's better to check 3 platforms consistently than 10 platforms randomly.

[GRAPHIC: Weekly routine]

**Suggested weekly routine:**
- Monday: Check Handshake for new jobs/events
- Wednesday: Check LinkedIn jobs and networking
- Friday: Check Indeed for new listings
- Daily: 5 minutes updating Daily Action Tracker
