## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

A $50,000 salary with great benefits might be worth more than $55,000 with none.

But most new grads don't know how to calculate that. They just look at the salary number and pick the bigger one.

That's a mistake. Let me show you what total compensation really means — and how to value it.

## OBJECTIVES (0:30-0:45)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Understand all components of total compensation
- Value benefits and perks in dollar terms
- Identify what's negotiable beyond salary

## SECTION 1: What Is Total Compensation? (0:45-2:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, the framework]

Total compensation is everything you get for working somewhere — not just your paycheck.

[GRAPHIC: Total compensation components]

**The Components:**

**1. Base Salary**
Your annual salary, what we usually talk about.

**2. Benefits**
Health insurance, dental, vision, life insurance, disability.

**3. Retirement**
401k/403b matching, pension, stock options.

**4. Paid Time Off**
Vacation, sick days, personal days, holidays.

**5. Bonuses**
Signing bonus, performance bonus, annual bonus.

**6. Equity (if applicable)**
Stock options, RSUs, profit sharing.

**7. Other Perks**
Remote work, flexible hours, professional development, tuition reimbursement, wellness stipends.

[VISUAL: Cat, the point]

When you only compare salaries, you're missing most of the picture.

## SECTION 2: Valuing Benefits in Dollars (2:30-5:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the math]

Let me show you how to put dollar values on benefits:

[GRAPHIC: Health insurance value]

**Health Insurance:**
Average employer contribution: $7,000 - $15,000 per year for an individual.

If you're comparing a job with great coverage vs. one where you'd have to buy your own, that's a $7,000+ difference.

[GRAPHIC: 401k matching]

**401k Matching:**
Common match: 3-6% of salary.

If you make $50,000 and they match 4%, that's $2,000 per year in free money — IF you contribute.

[VISUAL: Cat, emphasis]

That 401k match is literally free money. If you're not taking it, you're leaving cash on the table.

[GRAPHIC: PTO value]

**Paid Time Off:**
Average value: ~$200/day (based on salary).

An extra week of PTO (5 days) = $1,000+ in value.

[GRAPHIC: Remote work value]

**Remote/Hybrid Work:**
Saves on: commuting, gas, parking, work clothes, meals.

Average savings: $2,000 - $6,000 per year.

[VISUAL: Cat, the example]

**Real Example:**

Job A: $55,000 salary, minimal benefits, no 401k match, 10 days PTO
Job B: $50,000 salary, full benefits, 4% 401k match, 15 days PTO

[GRAPHIC: Side-by-side comparison]

**Job A Total Value:** ~$55,000 + $2,000 (basic benefits) = ~$57,000

**Job B Total Value:** ~$50,000 + $10,000 (benefits) + $2,000 (401k match) + $1,000 (extra PTO) = ~$63,000

Job B is worth more, even though the salary is lower.

## SECTION 3: The One-Time vs. Ongoing Trap (5:00-6:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, important distinction]

Not all compensation is created equal. Pay attention to this:

[GRAPHIC: One-time vs. Ongoing]

**One-Time:**
- Signing bonus
- Relocation assistance
- Sign-on equity grants

**Ongoing:**
- Base salary
- Annual bonus potential
- 401k matching
- Health insurance
- PTO accrual

[VISUAL: Cat, the warning]

A $5,000 signing bonus is nice. But $5,000 more in base salary compounds forever.

[GRAPHIC: Compound example]

$5,000 signing bonus = $5,000 total (you get it once)

$5,000 more in base salary = $150,000+ over 30 years (raises compound on it)

[VISUAL: Cat, strategy]

If you're negotiating, prioritize base salary first. Signing bonuses are one and done.

---

## SECTION 4: Growth and Non-Monetary Value (6:30-8:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, beyond money]

Some compensation isn't in dollars but matters just as much:

[GRAPHIC: Non-monetary value]

**Learning Opportunities:**
- Will you develop new skills?
- Training programs offered?
- Mentorship available?

**Career Trajectory:**
- Where does this role lead?
- Promotion timeline?
- Internal mobility?

**Work-Life Balance:**
- Expected hours?
- Flexibility for life events?
- Vacation culture (do people actually take time off)?

**Company Stability:**
- Is the company growing or shrinking?
- Job security?

[VISUAL: Cat, the question]

Ask yourself: Which job makes you worth more in 2 years?

A lower-paying job that teaches you valuable skills might be worth more long-term than a higher-paying dead-end.

## SECTION 6: Negotiating Beyond Salary (9:30-10:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, strategic tip]

If salary is truly fixed, here's what to negotiate instead:

[GRAPHIC: Alternative negotiations]

**High Value:**
- Additional PTO
- Signing bonus
- Remote flexibility
- Start date (for other income or transition time)
- Professional development budget

**Medium Value:**
- Earlier performance review
- Title bump
- Equipment allowance
- Parking/transit benefit

[VISUAL: Cat, direct]

Always have a backup ask. If they can't move on salary, pivot: "I understand the salary is set. Would you be open to discussing an additional week of PTO?"
