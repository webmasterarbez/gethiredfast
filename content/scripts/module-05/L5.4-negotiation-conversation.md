## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

The moment of offer is the moment of truth.

What you say in the next 30 seconds can be worth thousands of dollars. The wrong response can cost you leverage forever.

Today, I'm giving you the exact words to use. Scripts you can follow word-for-word. No more guessing what to say.

---

## OBJECTIVES (0:30-0:45)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:

- Counter-offer professionally
- Handle common employer responses

## SECTION 1: Rule #1 — Never Respond Immediately (0:45-2:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the foundation]

The most important thing I can teach you:

[GRAPHIC: "Never respond immediately"]

When they make an offer, you pause. You don't say yes. You don't say no. You don't negotiate on the spot.

[VISUAL: Cat, the script]

Here's exactly what to say:

[GRAPHIC: Script #1]

**"Thank you so much for the offer. I'm really excited about the opportunity to join [Company]. I'd like to take some time to review everything. When do you need a decision by?"**

[VISUAL: Cat, why this works]

This response:
- Shows gratitude and enthusiasm
- Doesn't commit you to anything
- Gives you time to research and prepare
- Is completely professional

[VISUAL: Cat, the timeline]

You'll usually get 24-72 hours minimum. Use that time to review the offer in detail and prepare your counter.

---

## SECTION 2: Expressing Enthusiasm (Then Asking) (2:00-4:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the formula]

The formula for negotiation is: Enthusiasm + Ask.

[GRAPHIC: "Enthusiasm + Ask"]

You MUST express enthusiasm before asking for more. They need to know you want the job.

[VISUAL: Cat, wrong way]

**Don't say:**
"The salary is lower than I expected. I want $X."

[VISUAL: Cat, right way]

**Do say:**
"I'm really excited about this opportunity and the work your team is doing. I've reviewed the offer, and I was hoping we could discuss the base salary. Based on my research and the value I'd bring, I was hoping to get closer to $X."

[GRAPHIC: Script #2 - The Counter]

**The Full Script:**

"Thank you again for the offer — I'm genuinely excited about the role and the team. After reviewing everything, I wanted to discuss the compensation. Based on my research of market rates for this role in [location], and the [specific experience/skills] I'd be bringing, I was hoping we could get the base salary to $[Target]. Is there flexibility there?"

[VISUAL: Cat, the breakdown]

Notice the structure:
1. Thank them
2. Express enthusiasm
3. State you've done research
4. Reference your value
5. Make the ask
6. End with a question (opens dialogue)

## SECTION 3: Demo — Live Negotiation Scripts (4:00-8:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, demonstration mode]

Let me show you how this sounds in practice.

[GRAPHIC: Scenario 1]

**Scenario 1: Countering on Salary**

The offer: $45,000
Your target: $50,000

[ACTION: Cat role-plays the conversation]

**Employer:** "We'd like to offer you the Marketing Coordinator position at $45,000 per year."

**You:** "Thank you so much — I'm really excited about this. I'd like to take some time to review everything. When do you need a decision?"

[After reviewing...]

**You:** "Hi [Name], thank you again for the offer. I'm very enthusiastic about joining the team. After reviewing the compensation, I wanted to discuss the base salary. Based on my research of Marketing Coordinator roles in this market, and the customer service and social media experience I'd bring from day one, I was hoping to get to $50,000. Is there flexibility there?"

[GRAPHIC: Scenario 2]

**Scenario 2: They Say No to Salary**

**Employer:** "Unfortunately, $45,000 is the most we can offer for this position."

**You:** "I understand. I really appreciate you looking into it. Would you be open to discussing other aspects of the offer? For example, an additional week of PTO or a signing bonus?"

[VISUAL: Cat, the pivot]

If salary is fixed, pivot gracefully. Don't push on salary three times — you'll seem tone-deaf.

[GRAPHIC: Scenario 3]

**Scenario 3: They Meet You Halfway**

**Employer:** "We can go up to $47,500. Is that acceptable?"

**You:** "I appreciate you working with me on this. $47,500 works for me. I'm excited to join the team."

OR

**You:** "Thank you for the increase. If we can get to $48,500, I'll accept right now."

[VISUAL: Cat, the insight]

You can push once more, but know when to stop. Getting to $47,500 from $45,000 is a win.

---

## SECTION 4: Handling Tough Responses (8:00-10:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, objection handling]

Let's prepare for the hard responses:

[GRAPHIC: "That's our final offer"]

**Response 1: "That's our final offer."**

**You say:** "I appreciate you sharing that. I understand. Before I make my decision, is there any flexibility on other aspects of the offer — like start date, PTO, or professional development budget?"

[GRAPHIC: "We can't go higher on salary"]

**Response 2: "We can't go higher on salary — it's standardized."**

**You say:** "That makes sense. I understand salary bands. Would it be possible to discuss a signing bonus or an earlier performance review for a potential salary adjustment?"

[GRAPHIC: "What's your current salary?"]

**Response 3: "What's your current salary?"**

**You say:** "I'd prefer to focus on the value I'd bring to this role and what the market rate is for this position. Based on my research, I'm targeting $X to $Y."

[VISUAL: Cat, important note]

In many states, asking for salary history is illegal. You don't have to answer. And your past salary should NOT determine your future worth.

[GRAPHIC: "We need an answer now"]

**Response 4: "We need an answer now."**

**You say:** "I'm very interested, but this is an important decision. Could I have until [tomorrow/end of day] to review everything? I want to be 100% sure I'm making the right choice for both of us."

[VISUAL: Cat, high pressure warning]

If they truly won't give you ANY time to consider, that's a yellow flag about the company.

---

## SECTION 5: Negotiating Non-Salary Items (10:30-12:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, the alternatives]

Here are scripts for negotiating beyond salary:

[GRAPHIC: Non-salary negotiation scripts]

**Start Date:**
"Would it be possible to push the start date to [date]? I'd like to wrap up my current commitment properly / take a week to prepare for this transition."

**PTO:**
"Is there flexibility on vacation time? I was hoping for [X] days to start. Work-life balance is important to me and helps me bring my best to work."

**Remote/Hybrid:**
"The job description mentioned hybrid work. Could we discuss the specific arrangement? I'd be most productive with [X days] remote per week."

**Signing Bonus:**
"Given that salary is fixed, would a signing bonus be possible? Even $X would help with the transition."

**Professional Development:**
"Is there a professional development budget for this role? I'm committed to growing in this position, and I'd love to know what's available for training and certifications."

[VISUAL: Cat, the strategy]

Ask for one or two things, not five. Prioritize what matters most to you.

---

## SECTION 6: Accepting (and Declining) Gracefully (12:30-14:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, closing the deal]

Once you've reached agreement:

[GRAPHIC: Acceptance script]

**Accepting:**

"Thank you so much. I'm excited to accept the offer at [salary] with [any other agreed terms]. I appreciate you working with me on this, and I'm looking forward to starting on [date]. Could you send the updated offer letter?"

[VISUAL: Cat, get it in writing]

ALWAYS get the final terms in writing before you stop negotiating. Verbal agreements need to be in the offer letter.

[GRAPHIC: Declining script]

**If you need to decline:**

"Thank you so much for the offer. I've given this a lot of thought, and I've decided to pursue another opportunity that's a better fit for my goals right now. I really appreciate your time and consideration, and I hope our paths cross again."

[VISUAL: Cat, graceful exit]

Always decline gracefully. You never know when you'll encounter these people again.

## SECTION 7: Practice Assignment (14:00-15:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, your turn]

Here's your assignment:

[GRAPHIC: Practice steps]

1. **Download the Negotiation Scripts**

2. **Read them out loud** — multiple times. The words need to feel natural.

3. **Practice with someone** — a friend, family member, career counselor. Role-play the conversation.

4. **Record yourself** — watch it back. How do you sound?

[VISUAL: Cat, the key]

The first time you say these words should NOT be when there's a real offer on the line.

[GRAPHIC: Deliverable]

**Deliverable: Negotiation Script Prepared** ✓

Customize the scripts with your target salary, your specific experience, and your backup asks.
