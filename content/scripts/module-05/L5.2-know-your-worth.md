## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

You can't negotiate if you don't know what you're worth.

And you can't just guess. Saying "I want $50,000" means nothing if the market rate is $40,000 — or $60,000.

Today, I'm going to show you exactly how to research what your target roles actually pay. By the end, you'll have a salary range backed by data.

---

## OBJECTIVES (0:30-0:45)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Research salary ranges for your target roles
- Account for location and experience adjustments
- Define your target salary range (not a single number)

## SECTION 1: Why Research Matters (0:45-2:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, setting context]

There are two ways to negotiate:

[GRAPHIC: Two approaches]

**Bad approach:** "I feel like I should ask for more."

**Good approach:** "Based on market data, the range for this role in this location is $X to $Y. I'm targeting the higher end because of my relevant experience."

[VISUAL: Cat, the difference]

One is a feeling. One is a fact.

Hiring managers respond to facts. When you come with data, you're having a professional conversation. When you guess, you're gambling.

[GRAPHIC: Research = Confidence]

Research also helps YOU. You'll know if an offer is fair, low, or great. No more wondering if you got a good deal.

## SECTION 2: Salary Research Sources (2:00-5:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, transitioning to demo]

Let me show you the best places to research salaries.

[SCREENCAST: Opening browser tabs]

[GRAPHIC: Research sources overview]

**1. Glassdoor Salaries**
Best for: Company-specific data
What you'll find: Reported salaries by job title and company

[SCREENCAST: Navigate to Glassdoor, search a role]

**2. LinkedIn Salary Insights**
Best for: Role-specific ranges
What you'll find: Salary ranges based on job postings and self-reported data

[SCREENCAST: Show LinkedIn salary tool]

**3. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)**
Best for: Official government data
What you'll find: Median wages, job outlook, regional data

[SCREENCAST: Navigate to bls.gov, find Occupational Outlook Handbook]

**4. Indeed Salary Calculator**
Best for: Quick range estimates
What you'll find: Aggregated data from job postings

**5. Levels.fyi** (for tech roles)
Best for: Tech company compensation
What you'll find: Detailed breakdowns including equity, bonuses

[VISUAL: Cat, strategy]

Don't rely on just one source. Cross-reference at least 2-3 sources to get an accurate range.

## SECTION 3: Demo — Researching a Real Role (5:00-8:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, live demo]

Let me show you how to research a specific role. Let's use "Marketing Coordinator" as our example.

[SCREENCAST: Full research workflow]

**Step 1: Glassdoor Search**

[ACTION: Search "Marketing Coordinator" on Glassdoor]

Here I see the national average, but look — there's a range. $38,000 to $55,000.

[GRAPHIC: Screenshot of Glassdoor data]

**Step 2: Location Filter**

[ACTION: Filter by location — Minneapolis]

Now it adjusts for Minneapolis: $40,000 to $52,000. The Twin Cities are slightly above average for cost of living.

**Step 3: LinkedIn Cross-Reference**

[ACTION: Check LinkedIn Salary for same role and location]

LinkedIn shows $42,000 to $54,000. Close to Glassdoor — good, they're consistent.

**Step 4: Company-Specific Check**

[ACTION: Search for specific company on Glassdoor]

If you're interviewing at Target, let's check what Target pays for this role. Glassdoor shows Target Marketing Coordinators at $45,000 to $58,000.

[VISUAL: Cat, summarizing]

So for a Marketing Coordinator role in Minneapolis:
- General market: $40,000 - $54,000
- Target specifically: $45,000 - $58,000

That's your data.

## SECTION 4: Adjustments to Make (8:00-9:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, adjustments]

Raw data needs adjustments. Here's what to account for:

[GRAPHIC: Adjustment factors]

**1. Location**
Salaries vary significantly by city. A role paying $50,000 in Minneapolis might pay $70,000 in San Francisco. Always filter by your location.

**2. Experience Level**
Entry-level is usually the lower end of reported ranges. If a range is $45,000 - $65,000, entry-level is probably $45,000 - $52,000.

**3. Company Size**
Large companies often pay more than small ones for similar roles. Adjust expectations based on company size.

**4. Industry**
Marketing Coordinator at a tech company pays differently than at a non-profit. Same title, different reality.

**5. Your Unique Value**
Do you have a relevant certification? Bilingual skills? Specific software experience? These can push you higher in the range.

[VISUAL: Cat, realistic]

Be honest with yourself. You're entry-level. That's okay. But know where entry-level sits in the range.

## SECTION 5: Creating Your Salary Range (9:30-11:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the framework]

Never go into a negotiation with a single number. Create a range:

[GRAPHIC: Salary range framework]

**Your Range:**

**Floor (Lowest you'd accept):**
This is your walk-away number. Below this, the job doesn't work financially.

**Target (What you're aiming for):**
This is the number you'll ask for. Usually mid-to-upper range based on your research.

**Stretch (Best case scenario):**
This is what you'd get if everything goes perfectly. The top of the market rate.

[VISUAL: Cat, example]

**Example for Marketing Coordinator:**
- Floor: $42,000 (my minimum)
- Target: $48,000 (mid-range for my location)
- Stretch: $52,000 (upper range with my skills)

[GRAPHIC: Written out range]

[VISUAL: Cat, strategy]

When they ask about salary expectations, you'll give them your target-to-stretch range: "Based on my research, I'm looking for $48,000 to $52,000."

Never reveal your floor. That's for your decision-making only.
