## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Having multiple offers is a great problem to have.

But choosing between them? That can feel paralyzing. Which one is "right"? What if you pick wrong?

Let me give you a framework that makes the decision clear — or at least, much clearer.

## OBJECTIVES (0:30-0:45)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Compare offers using a structured framework
- Weigh factors beyond just compensation
- Make confident decisions

## SECTION 1: Why Decisions Feel Hard (0:45-2:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the challenge]

When you have multiple offers, everything feels like a trade-off:

[GRAPHIC: Common trade-offs]

- More money vs. better culture
- Better title vs. shorter commute
- Bigger company vs. more responsibility
- Higher growth vs. better work-life balance

[VISUAL: Cat, the problem]

Without a framework, you just spin. You make pros and cons lists that don't help. You ask everyone's opinion and get confused.

[GRAPHIC: "Analysis paralysis"]

The solution isn't more thinking. It's structured thinking.

[VISUAL: Cat, the promise]

I'm going to give you an Offer Evaluation Matrix that puts everything in one place and helps you actually decide.

---

## SECTION 2: The Offer Evaluation Matrix (2:00-5:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the framework]

Here's how it works:

[GRAPHIC: Matrix structure]

**Step 1: Define Your Factors**

List everything that matters to you. Typically:

- Compensation (total, not just salary)
- Growth opportunity
- Work-life balance
- Company culture
- Commute / remote flexibility
- Job responsibilities
- Manager / team
- Company stability
- Location
- Learning opportunity

[GRAPHIC: Factors listed]

**Step 2: Weight Your Factors**

Not everything matters equally to YOU. Rate each factor from 1-5 based on importance:

5 = Critical (deal-breaker territory)
4 = Very important
3 = Moderately important
2 = Nice to have
1 = Doesn't really matter

[VISUAL: Cat, example weighting]

For example, if work-life balance is critical to you, give it a 5. If company prestige doesn't matter, give it a 1.

**Step 3: Score Each Offer**

For each offer, rate how it performs on each factor (1-5):

5 = Excellent
4 = Good
3 = Average
2 = Below average
1 = Poor

**Step 4: Calculate Weighted Scores**

Multiply weight × score for each factor, then add them up.

[GRAPHIC: Calculation example]

**Example:**
| Factor | Weight | Offer A Score | Offer A Total | Offer B Score | Offer B Total |
|--------|--------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Compensation | 5 | 4 | 20 | 3 | 15 |
| Growth | 4 | 3 | 12 | 5 | 20 |
| Balance | 5 | 3 | 15 | 4 | 20 |
| Culture | 3 | 4 | 12 | 4 | 12 |
| **Total** | | | **59** | | **67** |

Offer B wins, even though Offer A has better compensation.

## SECTION 3: Factors Deep Dive (5:00-7:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, details matter]

Let's get specific about how to evaluate each factor:

[GRAPHIC: Factor evaluation guide]

**Compensation:**
Use your Total Compensation Calculator. Compare apples to apples — not just salary.

**Growth Opportunity:**
- Where can this role lead?
- What will you learn?
- What's the promotion timeline?

**Work-Life Balance:**
- Expected hours?
- Do people actually take vacation?
- Email culture outside work hours?

**Company Culture:**
- How did people treat you in the interview?
- What did Glassdoor reviews say?
- Did you talk to actual employees?

**Commute / Remote:**
- How much time per day?
- Cost (gas, parking, transit)?
- Flexibility options?

**Job Responsibilities:**
- Are you excited about the actual work?
- Does it use your strengths?
- Will you learn what you want to learn?

**Manager:**
- Did you click with them?
- What's their leadership style?
- Will they invest in your development?

**Company Stability:**
- Is the company growing or shrinking?
- Recent layoffs?
- Financial health?

[VISUAL: Cat, the insight]

The manager factor is often underrated. Your manager impacts your experience more than almost anything else.

## SECTION 4: The Gut Check (7:00-8:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, intuition]

After the math, there's one more step:

[GRAPHIC: "The Gut Check"]

Close your eyes. Imagine it's Monday morning. You're about to start at Company A.

How do you feel? Excited? Dreading it? Neutral?

Now imagine the same for Company B.

[VISUAL: Cat, trust yourself]

Your intuition is data too. It's processing things your conscious mind hasn't articulated yet.

[GRAPHIC: When numbers and gut agree]

**If the matrix and your gut agree:** You have your answer.

**If they disagree:** Dig deeper. What is your gut sensing that the matrix missed?

Maybe the manager seemed off. Maybe the culture felt forced. Maybe you're excited about growth even though it scored lower.

[VISUAL: Cat, the balance]

Use logic to analyze. Use intuition to validate. The best decisions use both.

---

## SECTION 5: Making the Decision (8:30-9:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, decision time]

Once you've done the analysis:

[GRAPHIC: Decision process]

**1. Pick your top choice**
Based on matrix + gut check.

**2. Imagine turning it down**
If you feel relief, maybe it's not the right choice. If you feel regret, that's your answer.

**3. Make the call**
Don't keep deliberating forever. At some point, you have enough information.

**4. Commit fully**
Once you decide, stop second-guessing. You made the best choice with the information you had.

[VISUAL: Cat, important truth]

Here's the truth: There's rarely one "perfect" choice. Most offers have trade-offs. You're choosing which trade-offs you're willing to accept.

[GRAPHIC: "Choose, then make it right"]

You don't find the right job. You take a job and make it right through how you show up.

---

## SECTION 6: What If Timelines Don't Align? (9:30-10:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical issue]

Real problem: Offer A expires before you hear back from Company B.

[GRAPHIC: Timeline strategies]

**Options:**

**1. Ask for an extension**
"I'm very interested and want to give this the consideration it deserves. Would it be possible to extend the deadline to [date]?"

Most companies will give you a few extra days.

**2. Be honest (carefully)**
"I'm finalizing my process and want to make a fully informed decision. I'm expecting to hear back from another opportunity by [date]."

This can work, but only if you've built rapport.

**3. Accept and keep interviewing**
Legally, you can do this. Ethically, it's a gray area. Only do it if you'd genuinely accept if the other doesn't come through.

[VISUAL: Cat, the reality]

These situations are stressful. Handle them professionally, and most employers will respect your process.
