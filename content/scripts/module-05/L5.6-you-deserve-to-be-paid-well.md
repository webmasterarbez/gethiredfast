## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

I know what some of you are thinking.

"But what if they take back the offer? What if they think I'm greedy? Who am I to ask for more?"

Let me address these fears head-on. Because they're standing between you and money you deserve.

---

## OBJECTIVES (0:30-0:45)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

- Believe you deserve to negotiate
- Overcome the fear of losing the offer
- Advocate for yourself confidently

## SECTION 1: The Fear of Losing the Offer (0:45-2:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, addressing the fear]

The biggest fear: "What if they rescind the offer?"

[GRAPHIC: "The offer rescind myth"]

Let me tell you the truth: This almost never happens.

[VISUAL: Cat, the data]

In 22 years of recruiting and coaching, I've never seen a company rescind an offer because someone negotiated professionally.

Think about it from their side:

[GRAPHIC: Employer perspective]

- They've spent weeks interviewing
- They chose YOU over other candidates
- They've announced the hire internally
- They've already invested time and money

They're not going to throw that away because you asked for $3,000 more.

[VISUAL: Cat, the worst case]

The absolute worst case? They say no. And you still have the offer at the original terms.

That's it. That's the risk. "No" is the worst case, not losing everything.

## SECTION 2: "Greedy" vs. Professional Advocacy (2:00-3:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, the reframe]

Some of you might worry: "I don't want to seem greedy."

[GRAPHIC: Greedy vs. Professional]

Let's separate these:

**Greedy:** Demanding unreasonable things, ignoring market data, being aggressive or entitled.

**Professional:** Having a conversation about fair compensation based on research and value.

[VISUAL: Cat, the distinction]

Asking for market rate is not greedy. Advocating for yourself is not selfish. Negotiating is not demanding.

[GRAPHIC: "Self-advocacy is professional"]

Would you think less of someone for knowing their worth? For being prepared? For asking a simple question?

Neither would an employer.

[VISUAL: Cat, flip the script]

In fact, many employers respect candidates who negotiate. It shows:
- You've done your research
- You value yourself
- You'll probably advocate for the team too

---

## SECTION 3: First-Gen and Low-Income Barriers (3:30-4:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, specific acknowledgment]

I want to speak directly to first-generation and low-income students for a moment.

[GRAPHIC: Unique barriers]

You may face unique barriers:
- Never saw family members negotiate
- Were taught to be grateful for any opportunity
- Feel like you're "lucky" to even get an offer
- Worry that asking for more is disrespectful

[VISUAL: Cat, understanding]

I understand where this comes from. These beliefs were often survival strategies. Being grateful and not rocking the boat kept things stable.

But the professional world works differently.

[GRAPHIC: Different context]

Companies have budgets. They expect negotiation. The rules here are different from the rules you grew up with.

[VISUAL: Cat, permission]

You're not being ungrateful by negotiating. You're playing by professional rules. And those rules say: know your worth and ask for it.

---

## SECTION 4: You're Negotiating for Your Future (4:30-5:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, bigger picture]

Here's how I want you to think about this:

[GRAPHIC: "Negotiate for your future self"]

You're not just negotiating for yourself today. You're negotiating for:
- The person who wants to pay off student loans
- The person who wants to save for a house
- The person who wants to support their family
- The person who wants financial security

[VISUAL: Cat, the responsibility]

That person is counting on you to advocate for them right now.

[GRAPHIC: Compound effect reminder]

Remember: Every $1,000 in starting salary compounds. The decision you make today affects decades of your financial life.

[VISUAL: Cat, the courage]

It takes courage to ask. But your future self will thank you.

---

## SECTION 5: The Permission You Needed (5:30-6:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, direct and warm]

If you've been waiting for permission to negotiate, here it is:

[GRAPHIC: "You have permission"]

You have permission to ask for what you're worth.
You have permission to advocate for yourself.
You have permission to believe you deserve fair pay.

[VISUAL: Cat, the affirmation]

Say it: "I deserve to be paid well for the value I bring."

[GRAPHIC: "You deserve to be paid well"]

Negotiation is self-advocacy. And you deserve to advocate for yourself.

---

## SUMMARY & CTA (6:00-6:30)
