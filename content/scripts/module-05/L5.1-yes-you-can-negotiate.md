## HOOK (0:00-0:45)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Here's a stat that should change your life:

[GRAPHIC: "84% of employers are willing to negotiate with entry-level candidates"]

84% of employers say they're willing to negotiate with entry-level candidates.

But only 38% of new grads even try.

[GRAPHIC: "38% of new grads negotiate"]

That gap? That's money you're leaving on the table. Every. Single. Time.

Let me show you why you can — and should — negotiate.

## OBJECTIVES (0:45-1:00)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Believe that entry-level negotiation is possible and expected
- Understand the employer's perspective on negotiation
- Know when and what to negotiate

## SECTION 1: The Negotiation Gap (1:00-3:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the data]

Let's look at the numbers:

[GRAPHIC: Negotiation statistics]

**The Gap:**
- 84% of employers expect negotiation
- Only 38% of entry-level candidates negotiate
- Result: Most people leave money on the table

[VISUAL: Cat, the math]

Here's why this matters more than you think:

[GRAPHIC: Compound impact]

Every $1,000 in your starting salary is worth over $500,000 over a 40-year career.

[VISUAL: Cat, breaking it down]

How? Because:
- Raises are percentage-based
- Bonuses are based on salary
- Future jobs anchor on current salary
- 401k matches scale with income

[VISUAL: Cat, emphasis]

That conversation asking for $3,000 more? It could be worth $1.5 million over your career.

Still think negotiation is just for executives?

## SECTION 2: What Employers Actually Think (3:00-5:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, insider perspective]

Let me tell you what hiring managers actually think when you negotiate:

[GRAPHIC: Employer reactions]

**When you don't negotiate:**
- "They might not know their value"
- "They'll probably accept any offer"
- "Hope they don't get frustrated with their pay later"

**When you do negotiate:**
- "They've done their research"
- "They advocate for themselves — good"
- "They'll probably advocate for our team too"

[VISUAL: Cat, the truth]

Here's a secret: employers often build negotiation room into initial offers.

[GRAPHIC: "Budget vs. Initial Offer"]

If the budget for a role is $50,000, they might offer $45,000 or $47,000 — expecting you to negotiate.

If you accept the first offer, you just gave them money back.

[VISUAL: Cat, reframe]

Negotiation isn't greedy. It's professional. Employers budget for it. They respect candidates who do their homework and ask professionally.

## SECTION 3: What's Negotiable (5:00-7:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, expanding options]

Salary isn't the only thing on the table.

[GRAPHIC: Negotiable items]

**Definitely negotiable:**
- Base salary
- Start date
- Signing bonus
- Remote/hybrid flexibility
- PTO and vacation days
- Professional development budget
- Job title

**Sometimes negotiable:**
- Relocation assistance
- Equipment/tech allowance
- Performance review timing
- Parking or transit benefits
- Tuition reimbursement

**Rarely negotiable:**
- Health insurance plans (company-wide)
- 401k matching percentages (company-wide)
- Core job responsibilities

[VISUAL: Cat, strategy]

Here's the smart approach: If they can't move on salary, pivot to something else.

"I understand the salary is firm. Would you be open to discussing an additional week of PTO?" or "Could we revisit the start date so I can finish my current commitment?"

Always have a backup ask.

## SECTION 4: When NOT to Negotiate (7:00-8:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, the exceptions]

There are a few situations where negotiation might not make sense:

[GRAPHIC: When not to negotiate]

**Don't negotiate if:**

**1. It's a union or government role with fixed pay bands**
These are set. Negotiation isn't an option. Focus on grade level or step placement instead.

**2. They explicitly said it's non-negotiable — and you've verified**
Some companies (especially startups) standardize pay. If they say it clearly, believe them.

**3. The offer already exceeds your target range**
If they offered $60,000 and your target was $55,000, maybe just say thank you. (Though you can still negotiate other items.)

**4. You desperately need the job and can't risk any friction**
Reality check: Negotiating professionally almost never loses offers. But if you're truly risk-averse, that's your call.

[VISUAL: Cat, the reality]

Here's the truth: Offers are rarely rescinded for professional negotiation. I've hired hundreds of people. I've never rescinded an offer because someone asked for more.

The worst that happens? They say no. And you still have the offer.

## SECTION 5: The Right Mindset (8:30-9:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, mindset shift]

I want you to reframe negotiation:

[GRAPHIC: Mindset shift]

**Old mindset:** "I'm being greedy by asking for more."

**New mindset:** "I'm advocating for my value and my future."

[VISUAL: Cat, direct]

You're not taking money from someone's pocket. You're having a professional conversation about fair compensation.

[GRAPHIC: "Negotiation = Self-Advocacy"]

The company has a budget. They made an offer. You're asking if there's flexibility. That's it.

[VISUAL: Cat, encouragement]

And here's what I want you to remember: You're not just negotiating for yourself today. You're negotiating for your future self — the one who wants to buy a house, pay off loans, save for retirement, support a family.

That person is counting on you to advocate for them right now.
