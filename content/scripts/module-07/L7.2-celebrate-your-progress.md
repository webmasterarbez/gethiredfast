[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera, warm and proud]

Take a moment.

Just... take a moment.

Look at everything you've created. Resume. LinkedIn. STAR stories. Network map. Negotiation scripts. A 90-day plan.

You came in feeling overwhelmed, maybe a little lost. Look at you now.

## SECTION 2: The Transformation (2:00-3:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, reflective]

Remember how you felt at the beginning?

[GRAPHIC: Before and After]

**Before:**
- "I don't know where to start"
- "My resume isn't good enough"
- "I don't know anyone who can help"
- "What do I say in interviews?"
- "I can't negotiate — I'm entry-level"
- "I'll never get hired"

**After:**
- You have a focused target
- Your resume is tailored and ATS-ready
- You have a network map and scripts
- You have STAR stories and frameworks
- You have negotiation data and scripts
- You have a 90-day plan

[VISUAL: Cat, direct]

The difference between those two versions of you? About 5-6 hours of focused work.

You did that. You invested in yourself. That matters.

## SECTION 3: When You Get Stuck (3:00-4:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, preparing them for reality]

Here's what I want you to know for the road ahead:

[GRAPHIC: When you get stuck]

**The doubt will come back.**
That's normal. When it does, revisit Module 6. Listen to the Inner Game lessons again. Use your reframe cards.

**Rejection will sting.**
That's human. Use your 24-hour rule. Feel it. Then log one action in your tracker and keep moving.

**You'll want to quit.**
Probably around week 3 or 4. Don't. That's the point when most people give up — right before things start working.

[VISUAL: Cat, the reminder]

**When you need a boost:**
- Come back to this lesson
- Re-read your reframe cards
- Look at your completed tracker
- Remember: You are more ready than you feel

## SECTION 4: Go Get That Job (4:00-5:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, final encouragement, warm and direct]

I've been doing this for 22 years. I've helped thousands of people find jobs.

And I want you to know something:

[GRAPHIC: "You have everything you need"]

You have everything you need.

The skills are there. The system is there. The plan is there. The only thing left is execution.

[VISUAL: Cat, the call to action]

Here's what I want you to do:

[GRAPHIC: Your first steps]

1. **Tomorrow:** Complete your first 3 actions from your 90-day plan
2. **This week:** Log every day in your tracker
3. **When you land the job:** Send me your success story

[VISUAL: Cat, genuine warmth]

I can't wait to hear about it. Seriously. I love getting those emails. "Cat, I got the job." Best part of my work.

[GRAPHIC: Success story submission link]

There's a link below to submit your success story. Use it. I want to celebrate with you.

## CLOSING (5:00-5:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, final words]

You came here because you wanted to get hired fast.

You did the work. You built the tools. You made the plan.

Now?

[GRAPHIC: "Go get that job"]

Go get that job.

[VISUAL: Cat, smiling]

I believe in you. Now go prove me right.
