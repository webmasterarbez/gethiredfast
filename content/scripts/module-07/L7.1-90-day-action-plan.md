## HOOK (0:00-0:45)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera, energized]

You've built the tools.

Resume. LinkedIn. STAR stories. Network map. Negotiation scripts. Research skills. Mental game strategies.

Now let's put it all together into a plan that gets you hired in the next 90 days.

[GRAPHIC: "Your 90-Day Action Plan"]

This isn't a wishlist. It's a specific, actionable, time-bound roadmap. By the end of this lesson, you'll know exactly what to do tomorrow, next week, and for the next three months.

## OBJECTIVES (0:45-1:00)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Create a 90-day action plan with specific milestones
- Integrate all your course deliverables into a system
- Commit to measurable weekly actions

## SECTION 1: The 90-Day Framework (1:00-3:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, introducing the structure]

90 days is the right timeframe for most job searches. Here's why:

[GRAPHIC: Why 90 days]

- Long enough to build momentum
- Short enough to stay focused
- Matches typical hiring cycles
- Allows for learning and adjustment

[VISUAL: Cat, the phases]

We're going to break this into three 30-day phases:

[GRAPHIC: Three phases]

**Phase 1: Days 1-30 — Foundation & Outreach**
Get everything set up and start reaching out.

**Phase 2: Days 31-60 — Momentum & Interviews**
Build on what's working. Interview actively.

**Phase 3: Days 61-90 — Negotiations & Offers**
Close the deal. Evaluate and negotiate.

[VISUAL: Cat, important note]

These phases overlap. You might get interviews in Phase 1 or still be building foundation in Phase 3. That's okay. The phases are guides, not rigid boxes.

---

## SECTION 2: Phase 1 — Foundation & Outreach (Days 1-30) (3:00-6:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, Phase 1 focus]

The first 30 days are about getting everything in place and starting to reach out.

[GRAPHIC: Phase 1 goals]

**Goals:**
- Finalize all job search materials
- Establish daily action habit
- Begin networking outreach
- Submit first 20-30 applications

[VISUAL: Cat, weekly breakdown]

- Practice/prep: 30 minutes

---

## SECTION 3: Phase 2 — Momentum & Interviews (Days 31-60) (6:00-9:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, Phase 2 focus]

By day 31, you should have some responses. Phase 2 is about building on what's working.

[GRAPHIC: Phase 2 goals]

**Goals:**
- Analyze what's getting responses
- Increase interviews
- Practice interview skills actively
- Maintain application momentum

[VISUAL: Cat, adjustments]

**The Analysis:**

[GRAPHIC: Questions to ask]

By day 30, review your tracker:
- Which applications got responses?
- Which networking outreach worked?
- What's NOT working that you should stop?
- What should you do more of?

[VISUAL: Cat, interview mode]

**Interview Focus:**

[GRAPHIC: Interview activities]

- Schedule mock interviews (career center, friends)
- Research every company before interviews
- Practice STAR stories out loud
- Prepare questions for each interviewer
- Send thank-you notes within 24 hours

**Weekly Minimums for Phase 2:**
- Applications: 8-10 (quality over quantity now)
- Networking: 5
- Interview prep: 1-2 hours
- Mock interview: 1 per week

[VISUAL: Cat, reality check]

Not getting interviews by Day 45? Revisit:
- Resume tailoring (are you matching keywords?)
- Application quality (spray and pray doesn't work)
- Network referrals (are you asking for introductions?)

---

## SECTION 4: Phase 3 — Negotiations & Offers (Days 61-90) (9:00-11:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, Phase 3 focus]

Phase 3 is about closing. If you've been consistent, you should have interviews and possibly offers.

[GRAPHIC: Phase 3 goals]

**Goals:**
- Convert interviews to offers
- Negotiate confidently
- Evaluate offers thoughtfully
- Make a decision

[VISUAL: Cat, closing activities]

**What to focus on:**

[GRAPHIC: Phase 3 activities]

- Follow up with every interview (more aggressively now)
- Use your negotiation scripts
- Compare offers with Total Compensation Calculator
- Ask for time to decide (don't rush)
- Trust your offer evaluation process

**Weekly Minimums for Phase 3:**
- Follow-ups: As needed
- New applications: 5 (keep pipeline going)
- Salary research: Update for any offer discussions

[VISUAL: Cat, what if no offer yet]

**If no offers by Day 75:**

Don't panic. Average job search is 3-6 months. But do review:
- Are you making it to final rounds?
- Is there feedback you're not applying?
- Do you need to expand your target roles?
- Is your network being fully utilized?

Return to specific modules as needed. This is normal.

## SECTION 5: Your Weekly Action Minimums (11:00-12:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, the baseline]

Here's your non-negotiable weekly baseline:

[GRAPHIC: Weekly minimums summary]

| Action | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Applications | 10 | 8-10 | 5 |
| Networking | 5 | 5 | As needed |
| Follow-ups | 3 | 5 | All pending |
| Practice/Prep | 30 min | 1-2 hrs | As needed |
| Tracker | Daily | Daily | Daily |

[VISUAL: Cat, sustainability]

**Adjust for your life:**

If you're working full-time while searching, these numbers might be lower. If you're searching full-time, they might be higher.

The key: Set targets you can ACTUALLY hit. A sustainable plan you follow beats an ambitious plan you abandon.

## SECTION 7: Milestone Checkpoints (14:30-15:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, tracking progress]

How do you know if you're on track?

[GRAPHIC: Milestone checkpoints]

**Day 15:** Materials finalized, 10+ applications sent, tracker habit established

**Day 30:** 30+ applications, 10+ networking outreaches, first responses coming in

**Day 45:** Multiple interviews scheduled or completed, clear sense of what's working

**Day 60:** Final-round interviews or offers in discussion, negotiation prep complete

**Day 75:** Offers in hand or imminent, evaluation process underway

**Day 90:** Offer accepted — or clear plan for continued search

[VISUAL: Cat, the reality]

Not everyone lands a job in 90 days. If you don't, that's okay. You'll have a system, momentum, and skills. The job will come.
