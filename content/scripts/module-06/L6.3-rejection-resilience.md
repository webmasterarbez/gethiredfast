## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

The average job seeker applies to 100+ jobs to get one offer.

That's 99+ rejections. Probably more.

If you're not prepared for that, rejection will crush you. And I don't want that to happen. Let's get you ready.

---

## OBJECTIVES (0:30-0:45)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Expect rejection as part of the process
- Have strategies for bouncing back
- Separate rejection from self-worth

## SECTION 1: The Reality of Job Search Numbers (0:45-2:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, the data]

Let's talk about real numbers:

[GRAPHIC: Job search statistics]

- Average applications per job seeker: 100-200
- Average interviews per job seeker: 10-15
- Average offers: 1-2

[VISUAL: Cat, doing the math]

That means if you apply to 100 jobs, you might hear back from 10-20. You might interview with 10. You might get 1-2 offers.

[GRAPHIC: "This is normal"]

The other 80-90 applications? No response. Rejection. "We've decided to move forward with other candidates."

[VISUAL: Cat, the preparation]

I'm telling you this not to discourage you, but to prepare you.

If you expect every application to lead somewhere, you'll be devastated by week two. But if you know the odds going in? You can pace yourself.

[GRAPHIC: "100 applications ≠ 100 failures"]

Every "no" is one step closer to "yes." It's just math.

## SECTION 2: Why Rejection Isn't Personal (2:30-4:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, perspective shift]

Here's something most people don't realize:

[GRAPHIC: Reasons for rejection]

**You might get rejected because:**

1. **The role was already filled internally**
   Many jobs are posted as formalities. They already have someone in mind.

2. **They got 500 applications**
   Even if you're great, they can only interview 10 people.

3. **The timing was wrong**
   They put a hiring freeze after posting. Budget changed. Priorities shifted.

4. **The ATS filtered you out**
   You were qualified, but the algorithm didn't catch the right keywords.

5. **Someone had an inside connection**
   Referrals get prioritized. It's not fair, but it's real.

6. **Random factors you'll never know**
   The hiring manager was having a bad day. Your name reminded them of someone they don't like. Literally anything.

[VISUAL: Cat, the truth]

In MOST cases, rejection has nothing to do with your worth or potential. You'll never know the real reason, and that's okay.

[GRAPHIC: "Rejection ≠ Your value"]

You are not your job search results.

## SECTION 3: The 24-Hour Rule (4:30-6:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the strategy]

When rejection hits, here's what to do:

[GRAPHIC: 24-hour rule]

**The 24-Hour Rule:**

Give yourself 24 hours to feel it. Really feel it.

- Be disappointed
- Be frustrated
- Vent to someone you trust
- Watch a comfort show
- Eat something you enjoy

[VISUAL: Cat, permission]

You're allowed to feel bad. Rejection hurts. Pretending it doesn't just makes it worse.

[GRAPHIC: "After 24 hours..."]

**After 24 hours:**

- Log one action in your Daily Action Tracker
- Apply to one more job
- Reach out to one more contact
- Move forward

[VISUAL: Cat, the balance]

Feel it. Then move. That's the balance.

Skipping the feeling leads to burnout. Staying in the feeling leads to paralysis.

---

## SECTION 4: Rejection as Redirection (6:00-7:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, reframe]

Here's a mindset shift that helps:

[GRAPHIC: "Rejection = Redirection"]

Sometimes rejection is protection from a job that wasn't right for you.

[VISUAL: Cat, examples]

**Think about it:**
- The job you didn't get might have had a terrible boss
- The company might have laid people off six months later
- The role might have been different than advertised
- Something better might be around the corner

[VISUAL: Cat, honest caveat]

I won't pretend every rejection is secretly a blessing. Sometimes it just sucks. But sometimes — looking back — you're grateful you didn't get certain jobs.

[GRAPHIC: "You can't see the path until you're on it"]

The offer you eventually accept might not have been available if you'd gotten that earlier job. We can't see how the paths connect until we're looking back.

---

## SECTION 5: Learning from Rejection (7:30-9:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, constructive approach]

Some rejections can teach you something. Some can't. Here's how to tell:

[GRAPHIC: When to ask for feedback]

**When to ask for feedback:**
- You made it to final round interviews
- You had a good rapport with the interviewer
- They rejected you gracefully (not ghosted)

**How to ask:**
"Thank you for letting me know. I really appreciated the opportunity to interview. If you have a moment, I'd love any feedback on how I could improve for future opportunities."

[VISUAL: Cat, realistic expectations]

Most won't respond. But some will, and that feedback is gold.

[GRAPHIC: When NOT to ask]

**When NOT to bother:**
- You got a form rejection email
- You never made it to interviews
- They ghosted you

[VISUAL: Cat, what you can learn yourself]

**Self-reflection questions:**
- Did I tailor my resume to this role?
- Did I research the company before interviewing?
- Were my answers specific with STAR stories?
- Did I follow up appropriately?

Sometimes you'll identify areas to improve. Sometimes you did everything right and it still didn't work. Both are possible.

## SECTION 6: Your Rejection Resilience Plan (9:00-10:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, creating the plan]

Let's build your plan for handling rejection:

[GRAPHIC: Rejection Resilience Plan]

**1. Feel it (24 hours max)**
What's your healthy outlet? Who can you vent to?

**2. Reframe it**
Reminder: It's usually not about you. It's math and timing.

**3. Move forward (one action)**
What's the smallest action you can take to get momentum back?

**4. Celebrate the attempt**
You put yourself out there. That takes courage. Acknowledge it.

[GRAPHIC: Deliverable]

**Deliverable: Rejection Resilience Plan** ✓

Write out your plan. Know what you'll do BEFORE rejection hits.

[VISUAL: Cat, the streak]

And remember: The more rejections you get, the more you're trying. A high rejection count means you're in the game. People who never get rejected aren't applying.

## SUMMARY & CTA (10:00-10:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]

Here's your rejection toolkit:

[GRAPHIC: Key takeaways]

- 100+ applications is normal — expect rejection
- Most rejection isn't about you
- 24-hour rule: feel it, then move
- Rejection might be redirection
- Create your plan before you need it

[GRAPHIC: "Next: Breaking Perfectionism"]

Next: Perfectionism paralysis — the fear that stops you from even starting.

[VISUAL: Cat, encouraging]

Every "no" is one step closer. Keep moving.
