## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

"I'm not qualified."
"They'll find out I'm faking."
"Everyone else knows what they're doing."

Sound familiar?

These are lies your brain tells you. And today, you're going to learn to talk back.

## OBJECTIVES (0:30-0:45)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Identify your personal imposter triggers
- Apply cognitive reframing techniques
- Create reframe cards you can use going forward

## SECTION 1: Recognizing the Inner Critic (0:45-2:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, identifying the voice]

The inner critic has a recognizable voice. It tends to speak in absolutes:

[GRAPHIC: Inner critic patterns]

**The Words:**
- "Always" — "I always mess up interviews"
- "Never" — "I'll never be as qualified as them"
- "Everyone" — "Everyone else has it figured out"
- "Should" — "I should know this by now"

**The Themes:**
- Comparisons to others
- Predictions of failure
- Dismissing achievements
- Catastrophizing mistakes

[VISUAL: Cat, the awareness step]

The first step is simply noticing: "Oh, that's my inner critic talking."

You're not your thoughts. You're the person observing your thoughts.

[GRAPHIC: "I'm having the thought that..."]

Try this: Instead of "I'm not qualified," say "I'm having the thought that I'm not qualified."

It creates distance. The thought is something you're having, not something you ARE.

---

## SECTION 2: The Cognitive Reframe Technique (2:30-5:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, introducing the technique]

Cognitive reframing means taking an unhelpful thought and finding a more accurate, helpful alternative.

[GRAPHIC: The reframe process]

**Step 1: Catch the thought**
Notice when the inner critic speaks. Write it down exactly.

**Step 2: Examine the evidence**
Is this thought actually true? What evidence supports it? What evidence contradicts it?

**Step 3: Create a more accurate thought**
Based on the evidence, what's a more balanced way to see this?

[VISUAL: Cat, important note]

A reframe is NOT toxic positivity. It's not pretending everything is great.

[GRAPHIC: Reframe vs. Denial]

**Not a reframe:** "I'm totally qualified and amazing!"
**Actual reframe:** "I have relevant experience in X, Y, and Z. I'm still learning, and that's okay."

The reframe has to be believable. If it feels fake, your brain will reject it.

---

## SECTION 3: Demo — Reframing "I'm Not Qualified" (5:00-7:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, demonstration mode]

Let me walk you through a real reframe.

[GRAPHIC: Original thought]

**The thought:** "I'm not qualified for this job."

[VISUAL: Cat, Step 1]

**Step 1: Catch it**
I noticed this thought when I read a job posting. I felt anxious and wanted to close the tab.

**Step 2: Examine the evidence**

[GRAPHIC: Evidence table]

| Evidence FOR | Evidence AGAINST |
|--------------|------------------|
| I don't have 2 years experience | I have relevant coursework |
| I don't know their specific software | I've learned similar software before |
| Other applicants might be better | I don't actually know who else is applying |
| | I have customer service skills they need |
| | The job description says "preferred" not "required" |

[VISUAL: Cat, the analysis]

Looking at this, the "I'm not qualified" thought isn't fully accurate. I'm not 100% qualified — but I'm also not 0% qualified.

**Step 3: Create the reframe**

[GRAPHIC: Reframe]

**Original:** "I'm not qualified for this job."

**Reframe:** "I meet some qualifications and I'm learning the rest. They're looking for someone who can grow, and I can grow."

[VISUAL: Cat, the feel]

Notice this doesn't feel fake. It's honest about what I don't have, but also acknowledges what I do have.

---

## SECTION 4: Common Thoughts and Reframes (7:30-9:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, providing examples]

Let me give you some common imposter thoughts and possible reframes:

[GRAPHIC: Reframe 1]

**Thought:** "They're going to find out I'm faking."
**Reframe:** "I'm still learning, and so is everyone else. Being new doesn't mean I'm faking."

[GRAPHIC: Reframe 2]

**Thought:** "I only got here because of luck."
**Reframe:** "I put in the work to get here. Luck might have helped, but it wasn't the only factor."

[GRAPHIC: Reframe 3]

**Thought:** "Everyone else knows what they're doing."
**Reframe:** "Most people are figuring it out as they go. They're just not showing their uncertainty."

[GRAPHIC: Reframe 4]

**Thought:** "I should already know this."
**Reframe:** "Not knowing something yet means I have the opportunity to learn it. That's growth."

[GRAPHIC: Reframe 5]

**Thought:** "If I make a mistake, it proves I'm not good enough."
**Reframe:** "Mistakes are how learning happens. They don't define my worth."

[VISUAL: Cat, the pattern]

Notice the pattern: We're not denying reality. We're adding context that the inner critic leaves out.

## SECTION 5: Creating Your Reframe Cards (9:30-11:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, practice time]

Now it's your turn.

[GRAPHIC: Exercise instructions]

**Exercise: Create Your Reframe Cards**

1. **Write down 3 imposter thoughts you have**
   What does your inner critic say most often?

2. **For each thought, do the reframe process**
   Catch it → Examine evidence → Create reframe

3. **Write the reframe on a card**
   Physical or digital — whatever you'll actually look at

[GRAPHIC: Reframe card template]

**Front:** [Imposter thought]
**Back:** [Evidence-based reframe]

[VISUAL: Cat, where to put them]

Put these cards where you'll see them when doubt hits:
- Phone wallpaper
- Bathroom mirror
- Desk or workspace
- Car dashboard
- Inside your Daily Action Tracker

[VISUAL: Cat, the key]

The goal isn't to never have imposter thoughts. The goal is to have a ready response when they come.

## SECTION 6: When Reframes Don't Work (11:00-12:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, honest moment]

Sometimes reframes don't feel believable. Here's what to do:

[GRAPHIC: Troubleshooting]

**If the reframe feels fake:**
Try making it more modest. "I'm completely qualified" might be too big a jump. "I'm learning and that's okay" might feel more true.

**If you can't find evidence against:**
Focus on the uncertainty. "I don't know for sure that I'll fail" is still a reframe from "I'm definitely going to fail."

**If the thoughts won't stop:**
That's okay. You don't have to stop the thoughts. You just have to not let them stop you. Action despite doubt is courage.

[VISUAL: Cat, the truth]

Reframes aren't magic. They're practice. The more you do them, the more your brain learns to question the critic automatically.

## SUMMARY & CTA (12:00-12:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]

Here's what you've learned:

[GRAPHIC: Key takeaways]

- The inner critic speaks in absolutes — catch those patterns
- Reframing = finding a more accurate, helpful thought
- A good reframe is believable, not just positive
- Create cards for your most common imposter thoughts
- Action despite doubt is courage

[GRAPHIC: Deliverable]

**Deliverable: Imposter Syndrome Reframe Cards** ✓

Create at least 3 reframe cards. Put them where you'll see them.

[GRAPHIC: "Next: Rejection Resilience"]

Next: How to handle rejection — because it's coming, and you need to be ready.

[VISUAL: Cat, encouraging]

You're learning to talk back. That's powerful.
