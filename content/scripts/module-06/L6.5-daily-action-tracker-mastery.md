## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Motivation is unreliable. It comes and goes.

Some days you wake up energized and ready to apply to everything. Other days, you can barely open your laptop.

But habits and systems? Those are reliable. That's why you have the Daily Action Tracker — your system for days when you don't feel like job searching.

## OBJECTIVES (0:30-0:45)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Use your Daily Action Tracker consistently
- Analyze what's working and what isn't
- Celebrate wins to build momentum

## SECTION 1: Why Tracking Works (0:45-2:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the psychology]

The Daily Action Tracker works because of psychology, not just organization.

[GRAPHIC: Why tracking works]

**1. It makes progress visible**
You can SEE what you've done. That's motivating.

**2. It creates accountability**
Even just to yourself. "Did I do something today?"

**3. It builds the streak effect**
Once you've tracked 5 days in a row, you don't want to break the streak.

**4. It shows patterns**
Over time, you see what's working and what isn't.

**5. It separates effort from results**
Results are unpredictable. Effort is controllable. Track what you control.

[VISUAL: Cat, the mindset]

The tracker isn't about being perfect. It's about being consistent. Showing up, day after day, even when you don't feel like it.

## SECTION 2: The Minimum Viable Day (2:00-4:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, key concept]

Here's the most important concept for momentum:

[GRAPHIC: "The Minimum Viable Day"]

On your worst day — when you're exhausted, rejected, overwhelmed — what's the smallest action that still counts?

[VISUAL: Cat, examples]

**Examples of minimum viable actions:**
- Read one job posting
- Update one bullet point on your resume
- Send one follow-up email
- Review one flashcard from your STAR stories
- Spend 5 minutes on LinkedIn

[GRAPHIC: "One action = day counts"]

That's it. On your worst day, that counts. You logged an action. The streak continues.

[VISUAL: Cat, the trap to avoid]

**The trap:** Thinking if you can't do everything, you shouldn't do anything.

**The truth:** Something is infinitely better than nothing.

[GRAPHIC: Something > Nothing]

On good days, do more. On bad days, do minimum viable. Either way, you're moving forward.

## SECTION 3: What to Track (4:00-5:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, the categories]

Let me show you what to log:

[SCREENCAST: Daily Action Tracker demo]

[GRAPHIC: Tracking categories]

**Daily Actions:**
- Applications submitted
- Networking outreach (messages, connections)
- Resume/LinkedIn updates
- Practice (interview prep, research)
- Follow-ups sent

**Weekly Wins:**
- Interviews scheduled
- Responses received
- New connections made
- Skills learned

**Notes:**
- What worked well
- What didn't work
- Ideas to try
- How you're feeling

[VISUAL: Cat, the bonus]

The notes section is underrated. Looking back, you'll see patterns: "I got more responses when I customized cover letters" or "Phone screens go better in the morning."

That's data you can use.

## SECTION 4: Celebrating Wins (5:30-7:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, important point]

This might feel silly, but it matters:

[GRAPHIC: "Celebrate wins"]

Celebrate your wins. Even the small ones.

[VISUAL: Cat, why it matters]

Job searching is mostly rejection and silence. If you only focus on outcomes (offers), you'll feel like a failure for weeks.

But if you celebrate effort wins, you build positive momentum.

[GRAPHIC: Wins to celebrate]

**Celebrate these:**
- Submitted 5 applications this week
- Had a conversation that felt productive
- Got a response (even a rejection — they read your application!)
- Completed your tracker 7 days in a row
- Pushed through a day when you didn't want to

[VISUAL: Cat, how to celebrate]

It doesn't have to be big. Tell someone. Write it down. Treat yourself to something small. Just acknowledge: "I did a thing. That matters."

[GRAPHIC: "Progress is progress"]

The feeling of accomplishment builds confidence. Confidence builds action. Action builds results.

---

## SECTION 5: Analyzing Your Data (7:00-8:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, pattern recognition]

After a few weeks, look at your tracker and ask:

[GRAPHIC: Review questions]

**1. What's getting responses?**
Custom cover letters? LinkedIn applications? Referral applications?

**2. What's not working?**
Spray-and-pray applications? Certain job boards? Certain industries?

**3. When are you most productive?**
Mornings? Evenings? Weekends?

**4. What drains you?**
Long sessions? Certain tasks? Identify and plan around them.

[VISUAL: Cat, optimization]

Use this data to work smarter:
- Do more of what works
- Do less of what doesn't
- Schedule hard tasks during productive times
- Plan recovery after draining tasks

[GRAPHIC: "Track → Review → Optimize"]

## SECTION 6: The 30-Day Commitment (8:00-8:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, the challenge]

Here's your commitment:

[GRAPHIC: 30-Day Commitment]

**30 days of daily tracking.**

Every day for 30 days, log at least one action.

Some days will be big efforts. Some days will be minimum viable. All days count.

[VISUAL: Cat, why 30 days]

After 30 days, tracking becomes automatic. It's not willpower — it's habit.

[GRAPHIC: Deliverable]
