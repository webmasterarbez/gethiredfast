## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Perfectionism isn't about doing things well.

It's about fear of not being enough.

And it stops more job searches than anything else I've seen. Let's break the pattern.

---

## OBJECTIVES (0:30-0:45)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Recognize perfectionism as a barrier, not a strength
- Apply "good enough" strategies
- Take action even when you don't feel ready

## SECTION 1: The Perfectionism Trap (0:45-2:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, naming the problem]

Perfectionism sounds positive, right? "I just want to do my best."

But here's what perfectionism actually looks like in job search:

[GRAPHIC: Perfectionism behaviors]

- **Editing your resume for the 47th time** — still not sending it
- **Waiting until you're "ready"** — which never arrives
- **Not applying because you don't meet 100% of requirements**
- **Rehearsing interview answers in your head forever** — never practicing out loud
- **Starting over from scratch** — because the first version wasn't good enough

[VISUAL: Cat, the result]

The result? Nothing gets done. Nothing gets submitted. You're "preparing" forever but never actually in the game.

[GRAPHIC: "Perfection is the enemy of done"]

Perfectionism isn't high standards. It's fear wearing a mask.

---

## SECTION 2: Why "Good Enough" Wins (2:30-4:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the alternative]

Here's the truth: Done is better than perfect.

[GRAPHIC: "Done > Perfect"]

A good resume submitted is infinitely better than a perfect resume in your drafts folder.

[VISUAL: Cat, the math]

Let's do the math:

[GRAPHIC: Comparison]

**Perfectionist approach:**
- Week 1: Perfecting resume (not submitted)
- Week 2: Still perfecting resume (not submitted)
- Week 3: Finally submits 3 applications
- Result: 3 opportunities in 3 weeks

**Good enough approach:**
- Week 1: Submits "good enough" resume to 10 jobs
- Week 2: Submits to 15 more, makes improvements based on responses
- Week 3: Submits to 15 more, keeps refining
- Result: 40 opportunities in 3 weeks

[VISUAL: Cat, the insight]

The person who submits early gets feedback from the real world. They learn what works. They improve while doing.

The perfectionist learns nothing because they never put anything out there.

---

## SECTION 3: The 80% Rule (4:00-5:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, the framework]

Here's a rule to break perfectionism:

[GRAPHIC: "The 80% Rule"]

If something is 80% ready, it's ready enough.

[VISUAL: Cat, application]

**Apply this to:**

**Resume:** Is it 80% good? No obvious errors? Clearly formatted? Send it.

**Cover letter:** Does it address the role? Show enthusiasm? Mention relevant experience? Send it.

**LinkedIn profile:** Is your photo professional? Headline clear? Experience listed? It's ready.

**Interview answer:** Do you have the main points? A STAR story structure? You're prepared enough.

[VISUAL: Cat, the permission]

You can always improve AFTER you start. But you can never improve what you haven't begun.

[GRAPHIC: "Iterate, don't perfect"]

The first draft is just that — a first draft. Not the final version. Give yourself permission to iterate.

---

## SECTION 4: The "Not Ready" Myth (5:30-7:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, addressing the fear]

"I'm not ready yet."

How many times have you said that?

[GRAPHIC: The truth about readiness]

Here's the secret: Nobody feels ready. Ever.

[VISUAL: Cat, examples]

- First-time managers don't feel ready to manage
- New parents don't feel ready to parent
- First-job employees don't feel ready for the job

[GRAPHIC: "Readiness comes from doing"]

You don't get ready and then start. You start and then get ready.

The feeling of readiness comes FROM doing, not before it.

[VISUAL: Cat, the challenge]

If you're waiting to feel ready, you'll wait forever. The only way forward is action despite not feeling ready.

That's not reckless. That's how everyone does it.

---

## SECTION 5: Your Perfectionism Breaker (7:00-8:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical exercise]

Here's your challenge:

[GRAPHIC: This week's challenge]

**This week, do ONE of these:**

1. **Apply to a job you don't feel 100% qualified for**
   (Remember: 60-70% of requirements = you can apply)

2. **Send a networking message you've been drafting forever**
   ("Good enough" beats "never sent")

3. **Submit your resume without one more edit**
   (It's ready. Really.)

4. **Do a practice interview out loud**
   (Imperfect practice beats perfect mental rehearsal)

[VISUAL: Cat, the point]

The goal isn't perfection. The goal is proving to yourself that you can act before you feel ready.

[GRAPHIC: "Action creates confidence"]

Once you see that imperfect action still gets results — or at least doesn't cause disaster — you'll break the perfectionism pattern.

## SUMMARY & CTA (8:00-8:30)

[GRAPHIC: Key takeaways]

- Perfectionism is fear, not high standards
- "Good enough" submitted beats "perfect" unsent
- 80% ready = ready enough
