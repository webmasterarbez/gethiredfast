## HOOK (0:00-0:45)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera, warm and understanding]

70% of people experience imposter syndrome at some point in their lives.

Maya Angelou. Albert Einstein. Michelle Obama. All admitted to feeling like frauds — like they didn't deserve their success, like they'd eventually be "found out."

[GRAPHIC: Famous names with imposter quotes]

If they felt it, maybe it's not a sign that you're actually a fraud.

Maybe it's just... normal.

Let's talk about imposter syndrome — what it is, why you're feeling it, and what to do about it.

## OBJECTIVES (0:45-1:00)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Understand what imposter syndrome actually is
- Recognize imposter thoughts when they occur
- Know that you're in very good company

## SECTION 1: What Is Imposter Syndrome? (1:00-3:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, defining the term]

Imposter syndrome is the persistent belief that you're not as competent as others perceive you to be — despite evidence to the contrary.

[GRAPHIC: Definition highlighted]

It's the voice that says:
- "I don't belong here"
- "I'm not qualified"
- "I got lucky"
- "Eventually they'll realize I'm a fraud"

[VISUAL: Cat, important distinction]

Here's what imposter syndrome is NOT:

[GRAPHIC: What it's not]

- It's NOT the same as being unqualified (you often ARE qualified)
- It's NOT low self-esteem (high achievers experience it most)
- It's NOT laziness or lack of effort
- It's NOT a sign something is wrong with you

[VISUAL: Cat, the paradox]

In fact, here's the paradox: The more capable you are, the more likely you are to experience imposter syndrome.

[GRAPHIC: "The imposter paradox"]

People who are actually incompetent rarely doubt themselves. It's the thoughtful, self-aware people who wonder if they're enough.

## SECTION 2: The 5 Types of Imposter Patterns (3:00-5:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, exploring the types]

Imposter syndrome shows up in different ways. See which pattern sounds like you:

[GRAPHIC: Type 1 - The Perfectionist]

**1. The Perfectionist**
"If it's not perfect, I'm a failure."
You set impossibly high standards and feel crushed when you don't meet them. Even 95% feels like failure.

[GRAPHIC: Type 2 - The Expert]

**2. The Expert**
"I need to know everything before I'm qualified."
You feel like a fraud because you don't know everything about your field. There's always more to learn, so you never feel ready.

[GRAPHIC: Type 3 - The Natural Genius]

**3. The Natural Genius**
"If I have to work hard, I must not be good at it."
You expect things to come easily. When you struggle, you feel like a fraud — not realizing that struggle is part of growth.

[GRAPHIC: Type 4 - The Soloist]

**4. The Soloist**
"If I need help, I'm not really competent."
You feel like you should be able to do everything alone. Asking for help feels like admitting you're not good enough.

[GRAPHIC: Type 5 - The Superhero]

**5. The Superhero**
"I need to excel at everything — work, school, relationships, health."
You feel like a fraud unless you're perfect in every area of life. One failure makes you feel like a complete failure.

[VISUAL: Cat, reassurance]

Most people identify with at least one of these. I know I do.

## SECTION 3: Why Community College Students Feel It More (5:30-7:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, addressing the audience directly]

I want to speak specifically to community college students, because you may experience imposter syndrome more intensely.

[GRAPHIC: Why CC students feel it more]

**1. First-generation college students**
If no one in your family went to college, you don't have role models who've been through this. Everything feels like you're figuring it out alone.

**2. Non-traditional paths**
You took a different route than the "straight to four-year university" path. Society sometimes treats that as "less than." It's not — but the messaging is there.

**3. Working while studying**
You've been juggling school, work, maybe family. You haven't had time to build the polished LinkedIn or stacked resume that some peers have.

**4. Economic barriers**
You may not have had unpaid internships, expensive resume services, or professional networks handed to you. You built what you have from scratch.

[VISUAL: Cat, the reframe]

But here's what I want you to hear:

[GRAPHIC: "Your path is valid"]

Those challenges? They developed skills. Resilience. Time management. Problem-solving. Real-world experience.

You're not behind. You're prepared differently. And that's valuable.

## SECTION 4: The Imposter-Competence Gap (7:00-8:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, the insight]

Here's something fascinating about imposter syndrome:

[GRAPHIC: The gap illustration]

There's a gap between how competent you ARE and how competent you FEEL.

[VISUAL: Cat, examples]

**People with imposter syndrome:**
Competence level: HIGH
Felt competence: LOW
Gap: They feel like they're faking it

**People without imposter syndrome:**
Competence level: Varies
Felt competence: Matches or exceeds reality
Gap: Little to none

[VISUAL: Cat, the takeaway]

If you feel like a fraud, it doesn't mean you ARE a fraud. It means your self-perception hasn't caught up to your actual abilities.

[GRAPHIC: "Feelings aren't facts"]

Your feelings about yourself are not accurate measures of your competence.

## SECTION 5: Famous "Imposters" (8:30-9:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, inspiration]

Let me share some quotes from incredibly successful people:

[GRAPHIC: Maya Angelou quote]

**Maya Angelou** (author, poet):
"I have written eleven books, but each time I think, 'Uh oh, they're going to find out now. I've run a game on everybody.'"

[GRAPHIC: Albert Einstein quote]

**Albert Einstein:**
"The exaggerated esteem in which my lifework is held makes me very ill at ease. I feel compelled to think of myself as an involuntary swindler."

[GRAPHIC: Michelle Obama quote]

**Michelle Obama:**
"It doesn't go away, that feeling that you shouldn't take me that seriously. I still feel that way sometimes."

[VISUAL: Cat, the point]

If they felt like impostors — with all their accomplishments — then maybe imposter syndrome isn't a sign that you're actually a fraud.

Maybe it's just part of being human. Especially a human who's growing.

---

## SECTION 6: The Reframe (9:30-10:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the shift]

Here's how I want you to think about imposter syndrome:

[GRAPHIC: New perspective]

Imposter syndrome is often a sign you're in the right place.

If you feel like you don't belong, it might mean you're stepping outside your comfort zone. You're challenging yourself. You're growing.

[VISUAL: Cat, the truth]

Comfortable people don't feel like impostors. People who are stretching do.

[GRAPHIC: "Imposter syndrome = Growth"]

So when that voice speaks up — the one that says you don't belong — try this response:

"This feeling means I'm growing. And I'm going to keep going anyway."
