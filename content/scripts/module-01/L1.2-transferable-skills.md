## HOOK (0:00-0:45)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

"I don't have any experience."

I've heard this from hundreds of students. And every single time, they're wrong.

You think you don't have experience? Let me show you something. Every group project, part-time job, family responsibility, and volunteer activity has given you skills employers want.

Let's find yours.

## OBJECTIVES (0:45-1:00)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Identify at least 10 transferable skills from your experiences
- Know how to translate them into professional language
- Start seeing your value (hello, imposter syndrome antidote)

## SECTION 1: What Are Transferable Skills? (1:00-2:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, explaining]

Transferable skills are abilities you can use in any job — regardless of the industry or specific role.

[GRAPHIC: Skill examples with icons]

Things like:
- Communication
- Problem-solving
- Teamwork
- Organization
- Customer service
- Attention to detail

[VISUAL: Cat, making the connection]

Here's what's interesting: you develop these skills everywhere. Not just at jobs. School projects. Babysitting. Sports. Volunteer work. Even personal challenges.

[GRAPHIC: "Skills are built everywhere" with icons]

Employers know this. They want to see transferable skills because they know those skills will translate to their workplace.

[VISUAL: Cat, the key insight]

The problem? Most students don't know how to talk about these skills. They think "I was a cashier" isn't impressive. But it is — you just need to translate it.

Let me show you how.

---

## SECTION 2: Demo — Translating "Cashier" (2:30-5:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, demonstration mode]

Let's say your only work experience is being a cashier at Target. You're thinking, "How is that relevant to anything?"

Watch this.

[GRAPHIC: "Cashier at Target" appears on screen]

Let's break down what you actually did:

[GRAPHIC: Skill 1 appears]

**Cash handling and accuracy** — You handled hundreds of transactions without messing up. That's attention to detail and financial responsibility.

[GRAPHIC: Skill 2 appears]

**Customer service under pressure** — Long lines, frustrated customers, problems with returns. You stayed calm and solved problems. That's customer relations and conflict resolution.

[GRAPHIC: Skill 3 appears]

**Multi-tasking** — Scanning items, answering questions, handling payments, bagging — all at the same time. That's juggling competing priorities.

[GRAPHIC: Skill 4 appears]

**Point-of-sale technology** — You learned the register system, the inventory lookup, the returns process. That's technology adaptation.

[GRAPHIC: Skill 5 appears]

**Teamwork and reliability** — You showed up on time, covered for coworkers, communicated with managers. That's dependability and collaboration.

[VISUAL: Cat, reveal moment]

Look at that. Five valuable skills from "just" being a cashier.

[GRAPHIC: Before/After comparison]
- Before: "I was a cashier at Target"
- After: "Customer service, attention to detail, technology systems, multi-tasking, team collaboration"

[VISUAL: Cat, driving the point home]

See the difference? Same experience. Different language. And now an employer sees value.

---

## SECTION 3: Demo — Translating "Group Project" (5:00-7:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, second demo]

Let's do another one. A school group project.

[GRAPHIC: "Marketing Group Project" appears]

Let's say you worked on a marketing plan for a real local business. Here's what that becomes:

[GRAPHIC: Skill translations appear one by one]

**Collaboration** — You worked with 4 people with different schedules and skills. Managed disagreements. Found compromise.

**Project management** — You had a deadline. You divided tasks. You tracked progress. You delivered.

**Client communication** — You talked to a real business owner. Got requirements. Managed expectations.

**Research and analysis** — You researched the market, analyzed competitors, gathered data.

**Presentation skills** — You presented to the class. Explained your work. Defended your choices.

**Written communication** — You wrote the report. Clear, professional, persuasive.

[GRAPHIC: Skills summary]

From one group project, you've got: Collaboration, Project Management, Client Relations, Research, Presentation, Writing.

[VISUAL: Cat, reality check]

Some employers will value that project as much as an internship — especially if you can talk about it well.

## SECTION 4: Skill Categories Employers Want (7:00-8:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, organized overview]

Now let me give you the categories. When employers look at candidates, they're typically scanning for skills in these buckets:

[GRAPHIC: 6 skill categories with icons]

**1. Communication** — Writing, speaking, presenting, listening

**2. Teamwork** — Collaboration, conflict resolution, supporting others

**3. Problem-solving** — Analysis, critical thinking, creativity

**4. Organization** — Time management, planning, attention to detail

**5. Leadership** — Initiative, decision-making, motivating others

**6. Technical** — Software, tools, specific systems

[VISUAL: Cat, actionable]

When you do the skills inventory in a minute, think about your experiences through these lenses. Which category does each skill fall into?

---

## SECTION 5: The Skills Inventory Exercise (8:30-11:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, transition to practice]

Alright, now it's your turn.

[GRAPHIC: Pause indicator]

If you haven't already, download the Transferable Skills Inventory and the Experience Brainstorm Worksheet.

[VISUAL: Cat, walking through the exercise]

Here's how this works:

[GRAPHIC: Step 1]

**Step 1: List your experiences.** Not just jobs. Include:
- Work (part-time, gigs, work-study)
- School (projects, clubs, leadership)
- Volunteer (events, nonprofits, community)
- Personal (family responsibilities, hobbies, challenges)

[GRAPHIC: Step 2]

**Step 2: For each experience, ask: "What did I do? What problem did I solve?"**

When in doubt, ask: what problem did I solve? That's a skill.

[GRAPHIC: Step 3]

**Step 3: Translate each skill into professional language.**

Not "I helped my little siblings with homework."
Instead: "Tutoring, patience, explaining complex concepts, adapting to different learning styles."

[VISUAL: Cat, encouragement]

Do this for each experience. List every skill. Even if it feels small.

[GRAPHIC: Target — 10+ skills]

Your target: at least 10 transferable skills. Most students end up with 15-20 once they really dig.

[VISUAL: Cat, if you're stuck]

If you found less than 10, you're not digging deep enough. Go back to the experience brainstorm prompts. Did you ever:
- Help someone?
- Organize something?
- Solve a problem?
- Learn a new tool?
- Lead anything?

That's experience. Count it.

## SUMMARY & CTA (11:00-12:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]

Here's what just happened:

You went from "I don't have experience" to having at least 10 skills you can talk about in interviews and put on your resume.

[GRAPHIC: Deliverable checkpoint]

**Checkpoint:** Your Transferable Skills Inventory should have 10+ skills now.

If it does — you're ready to move on.

[VISUAL: Cat, looking ahead]

In the next lesson, we're going to use these skills to build your Target Job Scorecard — identifying 2-3 roles that match what you've got.

[GRAPHIC: Keep this list reminder]

Keep this skills list. You'll use it throughout the course — on your resume, in STAR stories, in interviews. This is your foundation.

[VISUAL: Cat, affirmation]

You have more to offer than you realized. Let that sink in.
