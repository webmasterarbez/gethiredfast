## HOOK (0:00-0:45)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Everyone's talking about AI taking jobs.

The headlines are scary. "50% of jobs at risk." "AI will replace workers." Your parents might be asking if your major is even worth it.

Here's what those headlines aren't telling you: AI is also creating jobs and changing what skills matter. Let's talk about what that actually means for you — without the doom, without the hype.

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

- Understand which skills AI is less likely to replace
- Know how to research AI impact on your target roles
- Position yourself for an evolving job market

## SECTION 1: The Reality (1:00-3:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, honest assessment]

Let's be real about what's happening.

[GRAPHIC: Two truths]

**Truth 1:** AI is getting better at routine, repetitive tasks. Data entry, basic analysis, simple customer service responses — AI can do these faster and cheaper.

**Truth 2:** AI is terrible at judgment, creativity, empathy, and complex problem-solving. These are still very human skills.

[VISUAL: Cat, practical framing]

So what does this mean for you?

[GRAPHIC: The shift — Tasks vs. Humans]

It means the job market is shifting. Not disappearing — shifting. Roles are evolving to emphasize what humans do well that AI can't easily replicate.

[VISUAL: Cat, reassurance with reality]

The students who will thrive? They're not fighting AI. They're using it. They're becoming more valuable because they can leverage AI to do more.

Let me show you what that looks like.

## SECTION 2: Skills AI Won't Replace (3:00-5:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, the positive side]

Here are the skills that remain valuable — and often become MORE valuable — as AI grows:

[GRAPHIC: Skill 1 with icon]

**1. Complex Problem-Solving**
Not following a formula. Dealing with ambiguity, weighing trade-offs, making judgment calls when there's no clear answer.

[VISUAL: Cat, example]

AI can analyze data, but deciding what to do with that data when stakeholders disagree? That's you.

[GRAPHIC: Skill 2 with icon]

**2. Creativity and Originality**
Generating new ideas, making unexpected connections, designing things that didn't exist before.

[VISUAL: Cat, example]

AI can write content, but coming up with a campaign concept that actually resonates? Still human.

[GRAPHIC: Skill 3 with icon]

**3. Emotional Intelligence**
Reading people, managing relationships, navigating difficult conversations, building trust.

[VISUAL: Cat, example]

A chatbot can answer questions. A human can tell when someone needs more than an answer — they need to feel heard.

[GRAPHIC: Skill 4 with icon]

**4. Leadership and Influence**
Motivating teams, making tough decisions, taking responsibility, inspiring action.

[GRAPHIC: Skill 5 with icon]

**5. Adaptability**
Learning new skills quickly, adjusting to change, thriving in uncertainty.

[VISUAL: Cat, driving point home]

Notice something? These are all transferable skills. The same ones you identified in the last lesson. You already have the foundation.

## SECTION 3: How to Research AI Impact (5:30-7:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical guidance]

Now, let's talk about your specific target roles. How do you know if they're "safe"?

[GRAPHIC: Research approach]

Here's how to evaluate:

**1. Look at Job Postings**

[GRAPHIC: What to look for]

Search your target roles on LinkedIn or Indeed. Are they mentioning AI? In what way?

- "Experience with AI tools" = Good. They want humans who can use AI.
- "We're automating this function" = Caution. The role may be shrinking.
- "Looking for creative problem-solvers" = Good. Human judgment required.

[VISUAL: Cat, example]

Let's say you're targeting Customer Success roles. You might see:
- "Use AI chatbots to handle tier-1 inquiries" — AI handles basic stuff
- "Build relationships with key accounts" — You handle the human part

That's a healthy AI integration, not replacement.

**2. Ask: What's the Human Part?**

[GRAPHIC: The question to ask]

For any role, ask: "What's the part of this job that requires human judgment, creativity, or relationships?"

If the answer is "a lot" — the role is likely durable.
If the answer is "not much, it's mostly following procedures" — be cautious.

**3. Look for "AI-Enhanced" Roles**

[GRAPHIC: Emerging role types]

Some of the best opportunities are NEW roles that work with AI:
- AI trainers
- Prompt engineers
- AI ethics specialists
- "Human + AI" workflow designers

These didn't exist 5 years ago. More will emerge.

## SECTION 4: Positioning Yourself (7:30-9:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, actionable advice]

Here's how to position yourself for this evolving market:

[GRAPHIC: Strategy 1]

**1. Learn to Use AI Tools**

Don't fear them — use them. ChatGPT, AI writing assistants, automation tools. Familiarity with AI makes you more valuable, not less.

[VISUAL: Cat, practical tip]

Put it on your resume: "Proficient in AI-assisted writing tools." Mention it in interviews: "I use AI to draft first versions, then refine with my own judgment."

[GRAPHIC: Strategy 2]

**2. Emphasize Human Skills**

In your resume and interviews, emphasize the skills AI can't replicate: creativity, judgment, relationships, leadership.

[VISUAL: Cat, framing]

Frame yourself as "the human in the loop" — the person who makes sure AI output is actually good, accurate, and appropriate.

[GRAPHIC: Strategy 3]

**3. Stay Curious and Adaptable**

The market will keep changing. The best thing you can do is become someone who learns quickly and adapts.

[VISUAL: Cat, mindset shift]

Employers aren't just hiring for today's skills. They're hiring for your ability to learn tomorrow's skills.

[GRAPHIC: Strategy 4]

**4. Don't Panic**

AI transitions take time. Companies don't flip a switch. There's time to adapt, learn, and pivot. The key is staying aware, not paralyzed.

## SUMMARY & CTA (9:30-10:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]

Here's the bottom line:

[GRAPHIC: Key takeaways]

- AI is changing roles, not eliminating humans
- Focus on skills AI can't replicate: judgment, creativity, relationships
- Learn to use AI tools — become AI-enhanced
- Research your target roles for healthy AI integration

[VISUAL: Cat, encouraging]

You're not being replaced. You're being upgraded. Embrace the tools, emphasize your human value, and keep adapting.

[GRAPHIC: "Next: You Belong Here"]

In the next lesson, we're going to talk about something that might be holding you back more than AI ever could: imposter syndrome. And why you absolutely belong in the jobs you're targeting.

[VISUAL: Cat, direct]

Almost done with Career GPS. You're doing great.
