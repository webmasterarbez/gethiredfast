## HOOK (0:00-0:45)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

"What do you want to do with your life?"

If that question makes you want to run screaming from the room, you're in the right place.

Here's a secret: most people who seem like they have it all figured out? They don't. They just started somewhere. That's what you're going to do today — start somewhere.

## SECTION 1: The Wrong Question (1:00-3:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, debunking a myth]

Let's start by throwing out the question that's been stressing you out.

"What do you want to do with your life?" — That's the wrong question.

[GRAPHIC: Crossed-out question]

It assumes you should know. It assumes there's one right answer. It assumes you need to commit forever.

All of that is wrong.

[VISUAL: Cat, reframing]

Here's a better question: "What's interesting enough to start, and good enough to pay the bills?"

[GRAPHIC: New question appears]

That's it. You're not choosing a life sentence. You're choosing a direction to explore. Careers change. People pivot. The average person has 12 different jobs by age 52. You're not locked in.

[VISUAL: Cat, direct]

So stop looking for your "one true calling" and start looking for a reasonable next step. That's what we're doing.

## SECTION 2: The 3 Factors (3:00-6:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, teaching framework]

Here's the framework that actually works.

[GRAPHIC: Triangle with three points: Interests, Skills, Market]

When choosing a career direction, you're balancing three things:

[GRAPHIC: Highlight "Interests"]

**1. Interests** — What are you curious about? What could you read about or work on without getting bored? Not "passion" — just interest.

[VISUAL: Cat, making it relatable]

Maybe you're interested in technology, or helping people, or solving puzzles, or creating things. You don't have to be obsessed — just interested.

[GRAPHIC: Highlight "Skills"]

**2. Skills** — What are you good at? Or what could you become good at? This includes transferable skills — we'll get to those in the next lesson.

[VISUAL: Cat, practical]

Skills can be developed. You don't have to be an expert already. But it helps to have some natural ability or willingness to learn.

[GRAPHIC: Highlight "Market"]

**3. Market Demand** — Are people hiring for this? Will it pay the bills? This is the reality check.

[VISUAL: Cat, honest]

I'm going to be honest with you: following your passion into a field with no jobs is a recipe for frustration. You need roles that exist and pay.

[GRAPHIC: Venn diagram of all three overlapping]

The sweet spot? Where all three overlap. Interesting enough, skilled enough, in-demand enough.

[VISUAL: Cat, reassuring]

And here's the thing — you don't need a perfect overlap. You need good enough. A 3 out of 5 on each factor beats a 5 out of 5 on one and a 0 on the others.

## SECTION 3: Career Direction vs. First Job (6:00-8:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, important distinction]

One more thing before we move on. There's a difference between a career direction and your first job.

[GRAPHIC: "Career Direction" → "First Job" arrow]

Your career direction is the general field or type of work you want to explore. Healthcare. Business. Technology. Creative industries.

Your first job is just the entry point into that direction.

[VISUAL: Cat, example]

Let's say you're interested in marketing. Your first job might be:
- Social media coordinator
- Marketing assistant
- Customer success rep

[GRAPHIC: Three job titles branching from "Marketing"]

All of those could lead to a marketing career. You don't need to land the perfect job — you need to land a job in the right direction.

[VISUAL: Cat, lowering pressure]

This matters because it takes pressure off. You're not looking for the one perfect role. You're looking for any role that moves you in the right direction.

## SECTION 4: How to Explore (8:00-9:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical advice]

So how do you actually figure out your direction? Here's what works:

[GRAPHIC: Step 1]

**1. Look back at clues.** When did you lose track of time because you were engaged? What classes did you actually enjoy? What YouTube rabbit holes do you fall into?

[GRAPHIC: Step 2]

**2. Look at roles, not industries.** Don't think "I want to work in healthcare." Think "I want to solve problems, help people, and work in a structured environment." That opens up more options.

[GRAPHIC: Step 3]

**3. Research real roles.** Go to LinkedIn or Indeed. Look at actual job postings. What sounds interesting? What sounds terrible? That's useful data.

[GRAPHIC: Step 4]

**4. Talk to people.** Informational interviews — we'll cover these in Module 3 — are gold. Ask people what their job is actually like.

[VISUAL: Cat, encouraging action]

Don't overthink. Start exploring. You'll get clearer as you learn more.
