## HOOK (0:00-0:45)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Here's a mistake I see all the time: applying to everything.

"I'll just apply to every job I see and hope something sticks."

It never works. I've reviewed thousands of applications. The students who get hired fast? They're focused. They know exactly what they're targeting and why.

[GRAPHIC: "Target Job Scorecard"]

Today, you're going to get focused. By the end of this lesson, you'll have 2-3 specific job types to pursue — not random applications, but a real strategy.

---

## OBJECTIVES (0:45-1:00)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Identify 2-3 target job types to focus on
- Evaluate each option using a balanced scorecard
- Have a focused job search strategy

## SECTION 1: Why Focus Matters (1:00-2:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, explaining the problem]

Let me tell you what happens when you apply to everything:

[GRAPHIC: Problem cascade]

**Problem 1:** Your resume is generic. It can't speak to any specific role.

**Problem 2:** Your answers in interviews are vague. You can't explain why you want THIS job.

**Problem 3:** You burn yourself out. 100 applications with no responses is demoralizing.

**Problem 4:** You miss the hidden job market. Networking works better when you can tell people exactly what you're looking for.

[VISUAL: Cat, the alternative]

Now here's what happens when you focus:

[GRAPHIC: Benefits cascade]

**Benefit 1:** Your resume is tailored. It speaks directly to the role.

**Benefit 2:** You can explain exactly why you want this type of work.

**Benefit 3:** You're applying to fewer, better-fit roles — better ROI on effort.

**Benefit 4:** Networking works. "I'm looking for marketing coordinator roles at mid-size companies" gets referrals.

[VISUAL: Cat, the goal]

The goal: 2-3 target job types. Specific enough to focus, broad enough to have options.

## SECTION 2: The Target Job Scorecard (2:30-5:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, introducing the tool]

The Target Job Scorecard helps you evaluate options systematically. No more gut feelings — actual criteria.

[GRAPHIC: Scorecard template appears]

Here's how it works. For each potential role, you score it on 5 factors:

[GRAPHIC: Factor 1 highlighted]

**1. Interest (1-5)** — How interested are you in this type of work? 5 = fascinated, 1 = sounds awful.

[GRAPHIC: Factor 2 highlighted]

**2. Skill Match (1-5)** — How well do your transferable skills match what's required? 5 = strong match, 1 = no overlap.

[GRAPHIC: Factor 3 highlighted]

**3. Market Demand (1-5)** — How many jobs are available? Are companies hiring? 5 = tons of openings, 1 = rare roles.

[GRAPHIC: Factor 4 highlighted]

**4. Entry Accessibility (1-5)** — Can you realistically get hired at entry level? 5 = lots of entry roles, 1 = requires years of experience.

[GRAPHIC: Factor 5 highlighted]

**5. Growth Potential (1-5)** — Does this role lead somewhere? 5 = clear career path, 1 = dead end.

[VISUAL: Cat, how to score]

Add up the scores. Roles with 15+ are strong candidates. 20+ is a great fit. Below 12 — probably not worth your focus.

## SECTION 3: Demo — Scoring a Real Role (5:00-8:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, demo mode]

Let me show you how this works. Let's say you're considering: Marketing Coordinator.

[GRAPHIC: "Marketing Coordinator" scorecard]

**Interest: 4/5**
"I like the creative side of marketing. Social media, content creation, campaigns. Not my absolute passion, but definitely interesting."

[GRAPHIC: Score appears]

**Skill Match: 4/5**
Looking at your transferable skills: communication, organization, customer service, social media use. Solid match.

[GRAPHIC: Score appears]

**Market Demand: 4/5**
Quick search on Indeed: hundreds of marketing coordinator roles. Growing field. Companies hiring.

[GRAPHIC: Score appears]

**Entry Accessibility: 4/5**
Many require 0-2 years experience. Entry-level roles available. Community college degree accepted.

[GRAPHIC: Score appears]

**Growth Potential: 4/5**
Clear path: Coordinator → Manager → Director. Room to specialize in digital, content, brand.

[GRAPHIC: Total score revealed]

**Total: 20/25** — Strong candidate.

[VISUAL: Cat, contrast example]

Now let's try: Creative Director (same company).

[GRAPHIC: "Creative Director" scorecard]

- Interest: 5/5 (dream role)
- Skill Match: 2/5 (need design, leadership, portfolio)
- Market Demand: 3/5 (fewer roles)
- Entry Accessibility: 1/5 (requires 7+ years)
- Growth Potential: 5/5 (top of ladder)

[GRAPHIC: Total score]

**Total: 16/25** — Interesting, but not accessible now.

[VISUAL: Cat, the insight]

See the difference? Creative Director might be a goal. Marketing Coordinator is the entry point.

## SECTION 4: How to Research Roles (8:00-10:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical research tips]

Before you can score, you need data. Here's how to research quickly:

[GRAPHIC: Research sources]

**1. Job Boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, Handshake)**
- Search the role title
- Count the number of postings
- Read 5-10 job descriptions
- Note: requirements, skills, experience levels

[GRAPHIC: What to look for]

**2. Pay Attention To:**
- Required vs. preferred qualifications
- Common skills mentioned
- Education requirements
- Experience levels (0-2 years = accessible)

[GRAPHIC: Red flags]

**3. Red Flags:**
- All postings require 5+ years
- Very few postings in your area
- Skills you don't have and can't easily learn
- No clear job description (sketchy companies)

[VISUAL: Cat, time estimate]

This research takes about 15-20 minutes per role. Worth the investment — it prevents months of wasted applications.

## SECTION 5: Your Turn — The Exercise (10:00-13:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, exercise mode]

Alright, now it's your turn.

[GRAPHIC: Pause indicator]

Download the Target Job Scorecard if you haven't already.

[VISUAL: Cat, walking through steps]

Here's what to do:

[GRAPHIC: Step 1]

**Step 1: Brainstorm 3-5 Potential Roles**
Based on your interests and transferable skills, write down 3-5 job titles to explore. Don't filter yet.

[GRAPHIC: Example list]
Example:
- Marketing Coordinator
- Customer Success Representative
- Administrative Assistant
- Social Media Manager
- HR Assistant

[GRAPHIC: Step 2]

**Step 2: Research Each Role (15 minutes per role)**
Use job boards. Read descriptions. Note requirements.

[GRAPHIC: Step 3]

**Step 3: Score Each Role**
Fill out the scorecard. Be honest. Don't inflate scores because you "should" want something.

[GRAPHIC: Step 4]

**Step 4: Identify Your Top 2-3**
Roles scoring 15+ are your targets. If you have more than 3 above 15, pick the highest scorers.

[VISUAL: Cat, what if stuck]

**If you can't decide between two roles:**
That's fine. Keep both. Apply to both types. Let the market help you decide. Sometimes you don't know until you try.

---

## SECTION 6: What To Do With Your Targets (13:30-14:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, next steps]

Once you have your 2-3 target roles, here's what changes:

[GRAPHIC: Action items]

**1. Write them at the top of your Daily Action Tracker.**
Every action should move you toward one of these roles.

**2. Tailor your resume to these roles.**
When we get to Module 2, you'll customize for your targets.

**3. Tell people.**
"I'm looking for marketing coordinator and customer success roles." Specific = referable.

**4. Search smarter.**
Set up job alerts for these specific titles. Stop scrolling randomly.

[VISUAL: Cat, focus power]

Focus is power. You now have it.

## SUMMARY & CTA (14:30-15:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]

Here's what you accomplished:

**Deliverable:** Target Job Scorecard with 2-3 roles identified.

You went from "I'll apply to everything" to "Here are my 2-3 target roles with scores to back them up."

[VISUAL: Cat, looking ahead]

In the next lesson, we'll talk about AI and the future of work — how to make sure your target roles are positioned well for where the market is heading.

[GRAPHIC: Daily Action Tracker reminder]

Before you move on: add your target roles to your Daily Action Tracker. Write them at the top. That's your north star.

[VISUAL: Cat, encouraging]

You're getting clarity. Keep going.
