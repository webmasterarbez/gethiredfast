## HOOK (0:00-0:45)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera, warm and understanding]

I know what you're thinking.

"But I'm just a community college student. I don't have internships at Google. I don't have a network of professionals. I don't have impressive things on my resume."

I hear you. And I'm here to tell you something important:

You belong.

[GRAPHIC: "You Belong Here"]

Let's talk about the voice in your head that's telling you otherwise.

## OBJECTIVES (0:45-1:00)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Recognize imposter syndrome when it shows up
- Understand that you're not alone (everyone has it)
- Know how to work through it with action

## SECTION 1: What Is Imposter Syndrome? (1:00-2:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, defining the concept]

Imposter syndrome is the feeling that you're not qualified, that you don't belong, that everyone else has it together and you're the only one faking it.

[GRAPHIC: Common imposter thoughts]

It sounds like:
- "They're going to find out I don't know what I'm doing"
- "Everyone else here is more qualified"
- "I only got this opportunity because of luck"
- "I'm not ready yet"

[VISUAL: Cat, the reveal]

Here's the thing about imposter syndrome: almost everyone has it.

[GRAPHIC: Stats on imposter syndrome]

Studies show 70% of people experience it at some point. That includes CEOs, doctors, professors, and yes — the people who are going to interview you.

[VISUAL: Cat, normalizing]

The person hiring you? They've felt like an imposter too. They just kept going anyway.

---

## SECTION 2: Why CC Students Feel It More (2:30-4:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, addressing the specific audience]

Let me be real about something. Community college students often feel imposter syndrome more intensely than students at four-year universities.

Why?

[GRAPHIC: The comparison trap]

**The comparison trap.** You see students at "prestigious" schools with internships and connections. You're working part-time and commuting to campus. It feels like you're starting behind.

[GRAPHIC: The narrative]

**The narrative.** Society tells you that community college is "less than." That's garbage. But you've absorbed the message anyway.

[GRAPHIC: First-gen challenges]

**First-generation challenges.** If you're the first in your family going into a professional career, you don't have role models who went before you. You're navigating without a map.

[VISUAL: Cat, validating then reframing]

All of that is real. I'm not going to pretend it doesn't exist.

But here's what's also real: your path is not your potential. Where you started doesn't determine where you end up.

## SECTION 3: The Underestimated Advantage (4:00-5:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, flipping the script]

Let me tell you something about being underestimated.

[GRAPHIC: "The Underestimated Advantage"]

When people expect less from you, you have less to lose and more room to surprise them. That's actually an advantage.

[VISUAL: Cat, specific benefits]

Here's what CC students often have that others don't:

[GRAPHIC: Advantage 1]

**Real-world experience.** You've been working while studying. You understand workplaces, customers, and responsibility.

[GRAPHIC: Advantage 2]

**Resourcefulness.** You've figured out how to get things done with less. That's a skill employers love.

[GRAPHIC: Advantage 3]

**Hunger.** You're here because you want to be, not because it was just the expected next step. That motivation shows.

[GRAPHIC: Advantage 4]

**Diverse perspective.** You bring a viewpoint that people from privileged backgrounds don't have. That's valuable in a diverse workplace.

[VISUAL: Cat, direct affirmation]

The companies worth working for? They know this. They're actively looking for people like you.

---

## SECTION 4: Action Creates Confidence (5:30-7:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the key insight]

Now here's the most important thing I'm going to tell you in this lesson.

[GRAPHIC: "Action Creates Confidence"]

You don't need to feel confident to take action.

Action creates confidence — not the other way around.

[VISUAL: Cat, explaining the cycle]

Most people think it works like this:
Feel confident → Take action

But it actually works like this:
Take action → Build evidence → Feel confident

[GRAPHIC: Action → Evidence → Confidence cycle]

Every time you complete a lesson in this course, you're building evidence that you can do this. Every resume bullet you write, every STAR story you practice, every application you send — evidence stacks up.

[VISUAL: Cat, practical application]

That's why this course has you doing things, not just watching. You're building confidence through action. Real evidence beats imposter thoughts.

---

## SECTION 5: When It Hits (7:00-7:45)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical tools]

Imposter syndrome doesn't go away. Even after you get hired, it'll show up. Here's what to do when it hits:

[GRAPHIC: Quick tools]

**1. Name it.** "This is imposter syndrome. I know this feeling."

**2. Remember the evidence.** Look at your transferable skills list. Look at your Daily Action Tracker. You have proof.

**3. Take one action.** Don't wait to feel better. Do something small. Send one application. Write one bullet point. Action breaks the spiral.

[VISUAL: Cat, resource plug]

I've included an "Imposter Syndrome First Aid" download with this lesson. Print it. Keep it somewhere visible. Use it when those thoughts hit.

And if you need more, Module 6 — Inner Game — goes deeper on this.
