## HOOK (0:00-0:45)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

I've reviewed over 10,000 resumes in my career.

Most of them? I spend less than 6 seconds looking at them.

That sounds harsh, but here's the thing — I'm going to tell you exactly what I'm looking for in those 6 seconds, and what makes me throw a resume in the "no" pile. By the end of this lesson, you'll know how to get into the "yes" pile.

## SECTION 1: The 6-Second Scan (1:00-3:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, insider perspective]

Here's what happens when your resume lands on a recruiter's desk — or screen.

[GRAPHIC: Heat map of resume showing eyes scanning]

We scan. We don't read. Not at first.

In about 6 seconds, I'm looking for:

[GRAPHIC: Checkpoint 1]

**1. Your name and contact info** — Is it easy to find? Is the email professional?

[GRAPHIC: Checkpoint 2]

**2. Your most recent experience** — What were you doing? For how long? Is it relevant?

[GRAPHIC: Checkpoint 3]

**3. Education** — Where did you go? When will you graduate? What's your major?

[GRAPHIC: Checkpoint 4]

**4. Skills section** — Quick scan for keywords that match what we're looking for.

[VISUAL: Cat, the truth]

If any of these are confusing, buried, or missing — you're probably going in the no pile.

If they pass the scan — then I actually read.

[GRAPHIC: 6 seconds → 30 seconds → Interview]

You have 6 seconds to earn 30 more seconds. You have 30 seconds to earn a phone call.

## SECTION 2: Resume Anatomy (3:00-6:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, structural breakdown]

Let me walk you through what a good resume looks like, top to bottom.

[GRAPHIC: Resume template with sections highlighted]

**Header: Name & Contact**
- Your name, big and clear
- Professional email (no "partygirl123@...")
- Phone number
- City, State (no full address needed)
- LinkedIn URL (customized, not the random string)

[GRAPHIC: Highlight header section]

**Professional Summary (Optional)**
If you're new to the workforce, skip this or keep it to 2 sentences max. Bad summaries hurt more than they help.

[GRAPHIC: Highlight education section]

**Education**
- Degree and major
- School name
- Expected graduation date
- GPA if above 3.0 (optional)
- Relevant coursework or honors (optional)

[VISUAL: Cat, note for CC students]

For community college students, put education near the top since you're still in school or recently graduated.

[GRAPHIC: Highlight experience section]

**Experience**
- Job title
- Company name
- Dates (month/year)
- 3-5 bullet points per role
- Most recent first

This is where the action is. We'll spend the next lesson on writing killer bullet points.

[GRAPHIC: Highlight skills section]

**Skills**
- Technical skills
- Software/tools
- Languages
- Relevant certifications

## SECTION 3: Format That Works (6:00-8:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, design principles]

Now let's talk about how it should look.

[GRAPHIC: Design rule 1]

**Rule 1: Clean and Scannable**
White space is your friend. Don't cram everything. If it looks dense, it won't get read.

[GRAPHIC: Design rule 2]

**Rule 2: One Page**
Unless you have 10+ years of experience, stick to one page. For students and recent grads — always one page.

[GRAPHIC: Design rule 3]

**Rule 3: Standard Fonts**
Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman. Nothing weird. The goal is readability, not creativity.

[GRAPHIC: Design rule 4]

**Rule 4: No Graphics, Tables, or Columns**
Why? ATS systems (which we'll cover in lesson 3) can't read them. Your fancy design gets scrambled.

[GRAPHIC: Design rule 5]

**Rule 5: Consistent Formatting**
Same font sizes for same elements. Same date format. Same bullet style. Inconsistency looks sloppy.

[VISUAL: Cat, showing contrast]

[GRAPHIC: Side by side — cluttered vs. clean resume]

See the difference? Same content. One looks professional. One looks like a nightmare to read.

## SECTION 4: The 5 Resume Killers (8:00-10:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, warning mode]

Now let me tell you what gets resumes thrown in the trash. These are the instant nos.

[GRAPHIC: Resume killer 1]

**1. Typos and Grammar Errors**
One typo? You're done. It tells me you don't pay attention to detail. Proofread. Then have someone else proofread.

[GRAPHIC: Resume killer 2]

**2. Unprofessional Email**
sexystar89@gmail.com is not getting called back. Get a professional email with your name.

[GRAPHIC: Resume killer 3]

**3. Task Lists Instead of Achievements**
"Responsible for answering phones" tells me nothing. "Managed 100+ customer calls daily with 98% satisfaction" — now we're talking. More on this in the next lesson.

[GRAPHIC: Resume killer 4]

**4. Irrelevant Information**
I don't need your full address. I don't need to know you played soccer in high school (unless you led the team). Everything on your resume should be relevant to the job.

[GRAPHIC: Resume killer 5]

**5. Lies**
Don't do it. Recruiters verify. You'll get caught. One lie and you're done — not just for that job, but your reputation.

[VISUAL: Cat, emphasis]

These aren't minor issues. Any one of them can kill your application. Check your resume against this list before you submit anything.

## SECTION 5: Why CC Students Undersell Themselves (10:30-11:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, direct to audience]

Before we wrap up, I want to speak directly to something I see with community college students.

[GRAPHIC: Common underselling mistakes]

You undersell yourselves. A lot.

You write "cashier" when you could write "customer service specialist." You say "helped with" when you actually "led." You leave things off because you don't think they count.

[VISUAL: Cat, reframe]

Here's what I want you to understand: your resume isn't about modesty. It's about accurately representing your value.

That part-time job? You handled customers, managed stress, showed up reliably. That matters.

That group project? You collaborated, met deadlines, produced results. That matters.

[VISUAL: Cat, looking forward]

In the next lesson, I'm going to show you exactly how to transform those experiences into powerful bullet points. Don't skip it.

## SUMMARY & CTA (11:30-12:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]

Here's what you know now:

[GRAPHIC: Key takeaways]

- Recruiters scan for 6 seconds — make it count
- Clean format, clear sections, no fluff
- Avoid the 5 resume killers at all costs

[GRAPHIC: "Next: Bullet Points That Pop"]

Next up: Writing bullet points that pop. This is where your resume goes from "meh" to "yes, interview this person."

[GRAPHIC: Download reminder]

Before you move on, download the Resume Template and the Resume Mistakes Checklist. You'll use both.

[VISUAL: Cat, encouraging]

Let's turn that "nothing on my resume" feeling into something you're proud of.
