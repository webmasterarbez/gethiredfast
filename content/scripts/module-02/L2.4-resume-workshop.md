**Contact Information**

[VISUAL: Cat, common mistakes]

## SECTION 3: Experience (5:00-11:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, main event]

This is the big one. This is where you show your value.

[GRAPHIC: Experience section structure]

For each position, include:
- Job title
- Company name
- Location (City, State)
- Dates (Month Year – Month Year)
- 3-5 bullet points

[VISUAL: Cat, order and selection]

**Order:** Most recent first (reverse chronological)

**What to include:**
- Paid jobs (full-time, part-time, gig work)
- Internships
- Volunteer work (especially if limited paid experience)
- Significant extracurriculars (leadership roles)

[VISUAL: Cat, bullet point reminder]

Remember: achievement bullets, not task lists.

[GRAPHIC: XYZ formula reminder]

Use the XYZ formula: Accomplished [X] by doing [Y], resulting in [Z]

Start every bullet with an action verb.

[VISUAL: Cat, example]

[GRAPHIC: Example experience entry]

```
EXPERIENCE

Customer Service Associate | Target | Minneapolis, MN | June 2023 – Present
• Processed 200+ daily transactions with 99.7% accuracy, contributing to store's top-rated customer satisfaction scores
• Resolved customer complaints efficiently, reducing escalations to management by 40%
• Trained 4 new team members on POS systems and customer service protocols
• Maintained organized checkout area during high-volume periods (500+ customers daily)
```

[VISUAL: Cat, working through it]

Here's the process:

[GRAPHIC: Step-by-step]

1. List your experiences (jobs, volunteer, school projects)
2. For each one, write 3-5 bullets using XYZ formula
3. Start each bullet with an action verb
4. Include numbers wherever possible
5. Focus on your target role — what's most relevant?

[VISUAL: Cat, thin resume advice]

**If you don't have much experience:**
- Include volunteer work
- Include significant school projects
- Include extracurriculars with responsibilities
- Focus on transferable skills

[GRAPHIC: Pause for work]

Now's the time. Work on your experience section. This is the biggest chunk of the resume.

Take 10-15 minutes. Write it out. Don't worry about perfect — get a draft down.

[VISUAL: Cat, after pause]

Done? Good. We'll refine more after we finish the full draft.

## SECTION 4: Skills (11:00-12:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, skills section]

The skills section is where ATS finds its keywords. Make it count.

[GRAPHIC: Skills section structure]

**Organize by category:**
- Technical Skills: software, systems, tools
- Languages: if applicable
- Certifications: any formal credentials

[GRAPHIC: Example skills section]

```
SKILLS

Technical: Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint), Google Workspace, POS Systems, Social Media Management (Instagram, TikTok), Basic HTML
Languages: English (native), Spanish (conversational)
Certifications: CPR/First Aid Certified, Google Analytics Certificate
```

[VISUAL: Cat, keyword tip]

**Keyword strategy:**
Pull skills directly from the job descriptions you're targeting. If they ask for "Excel," include "Excel" — not "spreadsheets."

[VISUAL: Cat, checkpoint]

Fill in your skills section. Take 2-3 minutes.

---

## SECTION 5: Optional Sections (12:30-13:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, additional sections]

Depending on your situation, you might include:

[GRAPHIC: Optional sections]

**Projects** — Significant school or personal projects
**Leadership** — Club officer positions, team captain roles
**Volunteer** — If not in main experience section
**Awards/Honors** — Academic, professional, community

[VISUAL: Cat, when to include]

Include these if:
- They're relevant to your target role
- They demonstrate skills or accomplishments
- You have space (remember: one page)

Don't pad your resume with filler. Every line should earn its place.

---

## SECTION 6: Format & Polish (13:30-16:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, polishing mode]

Now that you have content, let's make sure it looks professional.

[GRAPHIC: Format checklist]

**Checklist:**
- [ ] One page only
- [ ] Consistent fonts (one for headers, one for body)
- [ ] Standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman)
- [ ] Consistent date formats
- [ ] Consistent bullet styles
- [ ] Clear section headers
- [ ] Adequate white space
- [ ] No typos or grammar errors

[VISUAL: Cat, proofread]

**Proofread carefully:**
1. Read it out loud
2. Read it backwards (catches typos)
3. Have someone else read it
4. Use spellcheck but don't trust it completely

[GRAPHIC: Typo warning]

One typo can kill your application. I'm serious. Proofread.

---

## SECTION 7: ATS Check (16:00-18:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, final validation]

Before you call it done, run it through an ATS checker.

[GRAPHIC: ATS check process]

1. Go to jobscan.co or tealhq.com
2. Paste your resume
3. Paste a job description for a role you want
4. Check your score

[GRAPHIC: Score target]

**Target: 70% match or higher**

[VISUAL: Cat, adjusting]

If you're below 70%:
- Add more matching keywords
- Check that your section headers are standard
- Make sure skills match the job requirements

[VISUAL: Cat, checkpoint]

Run the ATS check now. Adjust as needed.

---

## SECTION 8: Save & Prepare (18:00-19:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical finish]

Almost done. Let's make sure you're ready to use this.

[GRAPHIC: Save instructions]

**Save two versions:**
1. `.docx` (Word) — for ATS submissions and editing
2. `.pdf` — for clean viewing and some applications

**File naming:**
- `FirstName_LastName_Resume.docx`
- `FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf`

[VISUAL: Cat, storage tip]

Keep your master resume in a cloud folder (Google Drive, Dropbox). You'll be making copies and tailoring for different applications.
