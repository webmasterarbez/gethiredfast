## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

I've seen students spend 3 weeks perfecting a resume they never submit.

Meanwhile, someone with a "good enough" resume has already applied to 20 jobs, gotten 3 interviews, and landed an offer.

Perfectionism kills job searches. Today, we're going to break that pattern.

## OBJECTIVES (0:45-1:00)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Recognize perfectionism as fear in disguise
- Embrace "good enough" for forward momentum
- Commit to action over endless refinement

## SECTION 1: Perfectionism Is Fear (1:00-2:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, getting real]

Let me tell you what perfectionism actually is.

[GRAPHIC: Perfectionism = Fear]

It's not high standards. It's fear.

Fear of rejection. Fear of judgment. Fear of finding out you're not good enough.

[VISUAL: Cat, how it shows up]

It sounds like:
- "I'll apply when my resume is perfect"
- "I need to take one more course first"
- "I'm not ready yet"
- "What if they notice a flaw?"

[GRAPHIC: The trap]

Here's the trap: if you never submit, you never get rejected. But you also never get hired.

Perfectionism keeps you "safe" from failure by keeping you from trying. That's the worst outcome.

---

## SECTION 2: Good Enough Is Good Enough (2:30-4:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, reframe]

Let me tell you about "good enough."

[GRAPHIC: Good enough → Progress → Better]

A "good enough" resume submitted to 10 jobs will beat a "perfect" resume submitted to zero jobs. Every time.

Why? Because:
1. You learn by doing
2. You get feedback from real applications
3. Rejection teaches you what to improve
4. Sometimes "good enough" is actually better than you think

[VISUAL: Cat, iteration mindset]

Here's the secret: your first resume doesn't have to be your last.

[GRAPHIC: Iteration cycle]

Submit → Get feedback → Improve → Submit again

You can update your resume after every 5 applications. After every interview. After every rejection that teaches you something.

[VISUAL: Cat, practical]

The version you submit today is Version 1.0. Next week it might be 1.1. That's how it works.

---

## SECTION 3: The Math of Action (4:00-5:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, data-driven]

Let me give you some numbers.

[GRAPHIC: Application math]

Average application-to-interview rate: about 10-15%

That means:
- 10 applications → 1-2 interviews
- 50 applications → 5-7 interviews
- 100 applications → 10-15 interviews

[VISUAL: Cat, the implication]

If you're perfecting your resume for a month before applying, you're losing a month of applications. That's potential interviews. That's potential offers.

[GRAPHIC: Time vs. applications]

Sending 50 "good enough" applications beats sending 5 "perfect" ones. The math is clear.

---

## SECTION 4: Your Commitment (5:00-5:45)

[VISUAL: Cat, call to action]

Here's what I want you to do.

[GRAPHIC: The commitment]

**This week: Submit at least one application with your current resume.**

Not your perfect resume. Your current resume.

Then: note what happens. Did you get a response? Rejection? Silence? All of that is data.

[VISUAL: Cat, permission]

I'm giving you permission: your resume doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to be sent.

[GRAPHIC: Key reframe]

**Perfect resume never sent < Good resume applied today**
