## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

77% of job seekers are using AI tools. If you're not, you're at a disadvantage.

But here's the catch: using AI wrong can backfire badly. Recruiters can spot AI-generated garbage from a mile away.

Today I'm going to show you how to use AI the right way — as a power tool, not a replacement for your brain.

## SECTION 1: The Right Mindset (1:00-2:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, setting the framework]

First, let's get the mindset right.

[GRAPHIC: AI as editor, not writer]

**AI is an editor, not a writer.**

The best use of AI: you write the first draft based on YOUR real experience, then AI helps polish the language, suggest improvements, and catch issues.

The worst use of AI: asking it to make stuff up from nothing.

[VISUAL: Cat, why this matters]

Here's why this matters: in an interview, you have to talk about everything on your resume. If AI wrote it and you don't actually understand it — you're going to sound fake. Or worse, get caught lying.

[GRAPHIC: The authenticity test]

**The authenticity test:** Can you explain and defend every bullet point in a live interview? If not, rewrite it.

---

## SECTION 2: ChatGPT/Claude for Resume Bullets (2:30-6:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, transition to demo]

Let me show you how to use AI to improve resume bullet points.

[SCREENCAST: ChatGPT or Claude interface]

**Step 1: Write your raw draft first**

[ACTION: Type in the interface]

Here's a bullet point I wrote:
"I worked at the front desk and helped customers check in and answered their questions"

[VISUAL: Cat commentary]

That's my real experience, but it's weak. Let's make it stronger.

**Step 2: Ask AI to improve it**

[ACTION: Type prompt]

Prompt:
```
Improve this resume bullet point to be more achievement-focused. Use strong action verbs and quantify if possible:

"I worked at the front desk and helped customers check in and answered their questions"
```

[ACTION: Show AI response]

AI response:
"Managed front desk operations, processing 50+ guest check-ins daily while resolving inquiries and ensuring positive guest experiences"

[VISUAL: Cat, analyzing the result]

Better! More action-focused, includes a number, sounds professional.

**Step 3: Make it authentic**

[ACTION: Edit the result]

But wait — did I actually process 50+ check-ins? Let me adjust to be accurate:

"Managed front desk operations, processing 30+ guest check-ins daily while resolving inquiries and ensuring positive guest experiences"

[VISUAL: Cat, the process]

See the workflow? You write → AI improves → You verify and adjust.

[SCREENCAST: Another example]

**Another example:**

Raw: "I tutored kids in math after school"

Prompt: "Make this resume bullet more professional and achievement-focused"

AI output: "Provided personalized mathematics tutoring to 3-5 elementary students weekly, improving test scores and building foundational skills"

[VISUAL: Cat, checkpoint]

Again: check that it's accurate. Did you actually tutor 3-5 students? If it was 2, change it.

## SECTION 3: AI for Resume Tailoring (6:00-8:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, new use case]

AI is also great for tailoring your resume to specific job descriptions.

[SCREENCAST: Demonstration]

**The prompt:**

```
Compare my resume bullets to this job description. Suggest which keywords I should add or emphasize:

JOB DESCRIPTION:
[paste job description]

MY RESUME BULLETS:
[paste your bullets]
```

[ACTION: Show AI response with suggestions]

AI will identify gaps and suggest keywords you might be missing.

[VISUAL: Cat, the tool approach]

You can also use dedicated tools:

[GRAPHIC: Tool logos and purposes]

**Jobscan** — Compares resume to job description, scores keyword match
**Teal** — Full resume builder with AI suggestions
**Resume Worded** — AI feedback on resume quality

[VISUAL: Cat, practical workflow]

The workflow:
1. Find a job you want
2. Paste the description into the tool
3. Get keyword suggestions
4. Add relevant keywords to your resume (honestly)
5. Check ATS score
6. Submit

## SECTION 4: What AI Can't Do (8:00-9:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, important limits]

Now let me tell you where AI falls short.

[GRAPHIC: AI limitations]

**AI can't:**
- Create real experience you don't have
- Know which of your experiences is most relevant
- Make judgment calls about your career direction
- Guarantee accuracy of facts
- Replace your authentic voice in interviews

[VISUAL: Cat, the danger zone]

**The danger zone:**

[GRAPHIC: Warning examples]

- "Write me a resume for a marketing job" (from nothing) — You'll have a resume you can't explain
- "Make up some achievements" — You'll get caught in interviews
- "Lie about my experience" — Obviously no

[VISUAL: Cat, rule of thumb]

**Rule of thumb:** Only use AI output you can honestly defend in person.

---

## SECTION 5: Other Useful AI Tools (9:30-11:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, quick tour]

Let me give you a quick rundown of other AI tools worth knowing:

[GRAPHIC: Tool list]

**For Resume:**
- ChatGPT / Claude — Bullet improvement, tailoring suggestions
- Jobscan — ATS optimization
- Teal — Resume building and tracking

**For Interview Prep:**
- ChatGPT — Generate practice questions
- Claude — Practice answering (though nothing beats practicing out loud)

**For Networking:**
- ChatGPT — Draft outreach messages
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator — Find people to connect with

**For Research:**
- ChatGPT / Claude — Company research summary
- Perplexity — Research with sources

[VISUAL: Cat, time investment]

Learning these tools takes a few hours. That investment pays off across your entire job search.

---

## SECTION 6: Quick Demo — Outreach Message (11:00-11:45)

[VISUAL: Cat, bonus demo]

One more quick example: using AI to draft a networking message.

[SCREENCAST: ChatGPT]

Prompt:
```
Write a short LinkedIn connection request for someone who works in marketing at a company I'm interested in. I'm a community college student looking to learn about their career path. Keep it under 200 characters.
```

AI output:
"Hi [Name], I'm a community college student exploring marketing careers. I'd love to hear about your path at [Company]. Would you be open to a brief chat?"

[VISUAL: Cat, refinement]

Personalize it: add their actual name, specific company, maybe something you noticed about their profile.

AI gives you a starting point. You make it real.

## SUMMARY & CTA (11:45-12:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]

Here's what you can now do:

[GRAPHIC: Key takeaways]

- Use AI to improve bullet points (not create them from nothing)
- Tailor resumes with keyword suggestions
- Maintain authenticity — only claim what's real
- Leverage tools like Jobscan and Teal for efficiency

[GRAPHIC: The golden rule]

**Golden rule:** Can you defend it in an interview? If yes, use it. If no, rewrite it.
