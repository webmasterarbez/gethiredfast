# L2.2: Writing Bullet Points That Pop

**Module:** 02 - Brand Builder
**Duration:** 15 minutes (~2200 words)
**Type:** Video Lesson (Demonstration)

---

## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Watch this transformation.

[GRAPHIC: Before bullet appears]

**Before:** "Responsible for customer service"

[GRAPHIC: After bullet appears]

**After:** "Resolved 50+ customer inquiries daily with 95% satisfaction rating, reducing escalations by 30%"

Same job. Same experience. Completely different impact.

That's what we're doing today — transforming your bullet points from forgettable to unforgettable.

---

## OBJECTIVES (0:45-1:00)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Write achievement-focused bullet points (not job descriptions)
- Use the XYZ formula that works every time
- Quantify your impact even when you don't have exact numbers

---

## SECTION 1: Task vs. Achievement (1:00-3:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, foundational concept]

Let me explain the difference that separates good resumes from great ones.

[GRAPHIC: Two columns — Task vs. Achievement]

**Task-based bullets** describe what you were supposed to do.
**Achievement-based bullets** describe what you actually accomplished.

[VISUAL: Cat, examples]

Task: "Responsible for stocking shelves"
Achievement: "Maintained 100% inventory accuracy across 3 aisles, reducing customer complaints about out-of-stock items"

Task: "Answered phones"
Achievement: "Handled 75+ calls per shift, resolving 90% of inquiries without transfer"

[VISUAL: Cat, why it matters]

Why does this matter?

Every candidate lists tasks. "I was a cashier." "I answered phones." "I was responsible for..."

Boring. It tells me nothing about whether you were good at it.

Achievements tell me: this person produced results. This person made things better. I want that person on my team.

---

## SECTION 2: The XYZ Formula (3:00-5:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, teaching the formula]

Here's the formula that makes this easy.

[GRAPHIC: XYZ Formula displayed]

**Accomplished [X] by doing [Y], resulting in [Z]**

- X = What you achieved (the result)
- Y = How you did it (the action)
- Z = Why it matters (the impact)

[VISUAL: Cat, walking through it]

Let me break this down with a real example.

[GRAPHIC: Example building step by step]

**The experience:** You worked as a server at a restaurant.

**X — What you achieved:** Earned consistently positive customer reviews

**Y — How you did it:** By memorizing menu details and anticipating customer needs

**Z — Why it matters:** Increased repeat customers in your section by 20%

[GRAPHIC: Full bullet appears]

**Full bullet:** "Earned consistently positive customer reviews by memorizing menu details and anticipating customer needs, increasing repeat customers in my section by 20%"

[VISUAL: Cat, the power]

See how that reads? It's specific. It's impactful. It shows I made a difference — not just that I showed up.

---

## SECTION 3: Action Verbs That Work (5:30-7:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical tools]

Notice how that bullet started with an action verb: "Earned."

Not "Was responsible for." Not "Helped with." A strong, active verb.

[GRAPHIC: Weak starters to avoid]

Words to avoid:
- Responsible for
- Helped with
- Assisted
- Worked on
- Duties included

[GRAPHIC: Strong action verbs by category]

Use these instead:

**Leadership:** Led, Managed, Directed, Coordinated, Supervised

**Achievement:** Achieved, Increased, Improved, Exceeded, Delivered

**Problem-Solving:** Resolved, Solved, Identified, Analyzed, Streamlined

**Communication:** Presented, Negotiated, Persuaded, Collaborated, Trained

**Creation:** Created, Developed, Designed, Implemented, Launched

[VISUAL: Cat, practical tip]

I've included a full list of 150+ action verbs in your downloads. Keep it open when you're writing your resume.

Every bullet should start with a strong verb. No exceptions.

---

## SECTION 4: Live Transformations (7:00-11:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, demonstration mode]

Let me show you more transformations. These are real examples from students.

[GRAPHIC: Transformation 1]

**Student experience:** Cashier at Target

**Before:** "Operated cash register and provided customer service"

That's a task. Everyone knows what a cashier does.

**After:** "Processed 200+ transactions daily with 99.7% accuracy, while maintaining shortest average wait time on team"

[VISUAL: Cat, breaking it down]

Notice: specific numbers, comparison to team, proof of excellence.

[GRAPHIC: Transformation 2]

**Student experience:** Group project for marketing class

**Before:** "Worked on team project to create marketing plan"

Again, a task. Everyone in the class did that.

**After:** "Led 4-person team to create comprehensive marketing plan for local business, resulting in client implementing 3 of 5 recommendations"

[VISUAL: Cat, breaking it down]

Notice: leadership emphasized, specific outcome, real-world impact.

[GRAPHIC: Transformation 3]

**Student experience:** Babysitting/childcare

**Before:** "Babysat for neighbor's children"

**After:** "Provided reliable childcare for 3 children (ages 2-8), managing schedules, activities, and meal preparation for 15+ hours weekly over 2 years"

[VISUAL: Cat, breaking it down]

This shows reliability, responsibility, time management — all valuable.

[GRAPHIC: Transformation 4]

**Student experience:** Fast food worker

**Before:** "Made food and cleaned restaurant"

**After:** "Prepared 100+ orders per shift in fast-paced environment while maintaining food safety standards and contributing to restaurant's 4.5-star health rating"

[VISUAL: Cat, the point]

Every experience can be transformed. You just need to think about what you actually accomplished, not just what you were supposed to do.

---

## SECTION 5: When You Don't Have Exact Numbers (11:00-13:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, addressing a concern]

I hear this all the time: "But I don't know the exact numbers!"

That's okay. Here's how to estimate responsibly.

[GRAPHIC: Estimation strategies]

**Strategy 1: Use approximations**
"50+" "100+" "approximately 200"
These are honest and still impactful.

**Strategy 2: Use timeframes**
"15+ hours weekly" "Over 2-year period" "Daily basis"

**Strategy 3: Use comparisons**
"Fastest on the team" "Highest-rated section" "Above average"

**Strategy 4: Use descriptors**
"High-volume" "Fast-paced" "Complex"

[VISUAL: Cat, examples]

Don't say: "Handled some customer complaints"
Say: "Resolved 20+ customer complaints weekly"

Don't say: "Worked on busy days"
Say: "Worked high-volume shifts (500+ customers daily)"

[VISUAL: Cat, caution]

One warning: don't make up numbers. Estimate based on reality. If you're asked in an interview, you should be able to explain your estimate.

"I averaged about 6 hours per shift and handled roughly 50 customers per hour, so that's approximately 300 customers per shift."

---

## SECTION 6: Your Turn (13:00-14:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, practice time]

Alright, your turn.

[GRAPHIC: Exercise instructions]

Here's what I want you to do:

**Step 1:** Look at your current resume or your experience list from Module 1.

**Step 2:** Pick 3 bullet points that are task-focused.

**Step 3:** Rewrite each one using the XYZ formula.

- What did you accomplish?
- How did you do it?
- What was the result/impact?

**Step 4:** Start each with a strong action verb.

[GRAPHIC: Pause indicator]

Pause this video and do it now. Take 10 minutes. I'll wait.

[VISUAL: Cat, after pause]

Done? Good.

If your new bullets feel dramatically different — you're doing it right. If they still sound like job descriptions — go deeper. What was the outcome? What improved because you were there?

## SUMMARY & CTA (14:30-15:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]

Here's what you can now do:

[GRAPHIC: Key takeaways]

- Write achievement bullets, not task lists
- Use the XYZ formula (Accomplished X by Y, resulting in Z)
- Start every bullet with a strong action verb
- Quantify even when you don't have exact numbers
