## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

87% of recruiters use LinkedIn to find candidates.

If your profile is weak — or worse, nonexistent — you're invisible to opportunities. Jobs you never even knew existed are going to people who show up on LinkedIn.

Today, we're going to make sure you show up.

## SECTION 1: Why LinkedIn Matters (1:00-2:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, setting the context]

Before we dive in, let me tell you how recruiters actually use LinkedIn.

[GRAPHIC: Recruiter behavior stats]

- 87% of recruiters use LinkedIn to find candidates
- 70% of jobs never get publicly posted (the hidden job market)
- Recruiters search by keywords, skills, and location
- They check your profile before interviewing you

[VISUAL: Cat, the reality]

If you apply for a job, the hiring manager will probably look you up. If you don't have a profile, or it's sparse, that raises questions.

But here's the opportunity: if you have a strong profile, you can be found for jobs you never even applied to. Recruiters come to you.

[GRAPHIC: Found vs. Found missing]

A good LinkedIn profile works 24/7. While you're sleeping, recruiters are searching.

---

## SECTION 2: Profile Photo (2:30-4:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, photo guidelines]

Let's start with your photo. It matters more than you think.

[GRAPHIC: Photo guidelines]

**The rules:**
- Professional headshot style (head and shoulders)
- Clear, well-lit, recent
- You're alone in the photo (no crops of group photos)
- Dressed appropriately for your target industry
- Smiling or neutral expression (approachable)

[GRAPHIC: Photo examples — good vs. bad]

**Good:** Clear headshot, neutral background, professional attire
**Bad:** Party photo crop, dark lighting, sunglasses, unclear face

[VISUAL: Cat, practical tip]

You don't need a professional photographer. A smartphone in good lighting with a clean background works fine. Ask a friend to take a few shots.

[GRAPHIC: No photo warning]

Profiles with photos get 21x more views. If you have no photo, you're almost invisible.

---

## SECTION 3: Headline (4:00-6:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, prime real estate]

Your headline is the 220 characters under your name. It's prime real estate — don't waste it.

[GRAPHIC: Default headline crossed out]

The default is: "Student at [Your College]"

That tells me nothing useful. It's the equivalent of saying "Human Person."

[VISUAL: Cat, the better way]

Your headline should answer: What do you do? What do you want to do? What's your value?

[GRAPHIC: Headline formula]

**Formula:** [What you're pursuing] | [Key qualifications] | [Availability or value statement]

[GRAPHIC: Headline examples]

**Examples:**
- "Aspiring Marketing Professional | Community College Honors Student | Available May 2025"
- "Customer Success Specialist | Bilingual (English/Spanish) | Passionate About Client Solutions"
- "Business Administration Student | Leadership, Communication & Problem-Solving | Seeking Summer Internship"
- "Future HR Professional | SHRM-CP Candidate | Community College Dean's List"

[VISUAL: Cat, what to include]

Include keywords recruiters might search for. If you want marketing jobs, say "marketing." If you're bilingual, say it. Make it searchable.

---

## SECTION 4: About Section (6:00-8:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, your story]

The About section is your chance to tell your story. Think of it as your written elevator pitch.

[GRAPHIC: About section structure]

**Structure:**
1. Opening hook (who you are, what you do)
2. Your background and experience summary
3. What you're looking for / your goals
4. Skills and value you bring
5. Call to action

[VISUAL: Cat, example]

[GRAPHIC: Example About section]

```
I'm a business administration student at Saint Paul College, passionate about marketing and customer experience. With 2+ years of retail customer service experience, I understand what makes customers happy — and how to solve their problems fast.

Currently, I'm developing skills in digital marketing, social media strategy, and data analysis. I've completed Google Analytics certification and manage social media for our campus Business Club (growing followers by 150% in one semester).

I'm seeking marketing coordinator or customer success roles where I can combine my customer service experience with my growing marketing skills. I bring organization, communication, and a genuine passion for helping people.

Open to opportunities starting May 2025. Let's connect!
```

[VISUAL: Cat, tips]

**Tips:**
- Write in first person ("I" not "They")
- Be specific about your experience and goals
- Include keywords for searchability
- Keep it 3-5 short paragraphs
- End with a call to action

[GRAPHIC: About section template]

I've included a fill-in-the-blank template in your downloads.

## SECTION 5: Experience & Education (8:30-10:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, filling in the details]

Good news: if you just built your resume, this is easy. Transfer the information.

[GRAPHIC: Experience section]

**Experience:**
- Same information as your resume
- Can be slightly longer (LinkedIn allows more space)
- Add media if relevant (project links, portfolio)

[GRAPHIC: Education section]

**Education:**
- School name
- Degree and major
- Years attended
- Activities, honors, coursework

[VISUAL: Cat, add more detail]

LinkedIn lets you add more detail than a resume. Include:
- Volunteer experience
- Courses and certifications
- Projects
- Extracurriculars

[VISUAL: Cat, quick completion]

Fill these in matching your resume. Take 5-10 minutes.

---

## SECTION 6: Skills & Endorsements (10:00-11:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, searchability]

The Skills section is critical for being found. It's how recruiters filter candidates.

[GRAPHIC: Skills strategy]

**Strategy:**
- Add at least 5 skills (LinkedIn allows up to 50)
- Pin your top 3 most relevant to your target roles
- Match skills to job descriptions you're targeting
- Include both technical and soft skills

[GRAPHIC: Example skills]

**Examples:**
- Customer Service
- Microsoft Excel
- Social Media Marketing
- Project Management
- Team Collaboration
- Data Analysis
- Communication

[VISUAL: Cat, endorsements]

Endorsements help validate your skills. After you complete your profile, ask classmates, coworkers, or supervisors to endorse your top skills.

---

## SECTION 7: Getting to All-Star (11:30-13:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, the goal]

LinkedIn has a profile strength meter. Your goal: All-Star status.

[GRAPHIC: All-Star requirements]

**To reach All-Star, you need:**
- Profile photo
- Headline
- Industry and location
- Current position (or student position)
- Education
- At least 5 skills
- 50+ connections

[VISUAL: Cat, most missed]

Most students miss: the 50 connections.

[GRAPHIC: Connection strategy]

**Quick wins for connections:**
- Connect with classmates (easy approval)
- Connect with professors (they'll usually accept)
- Connect with coworkers (current and former)
- Connect with family friends in professional roles
- Connect with people you meet at networking events

[VISUAL: Cat, the benefit]

All-Star profiles appear higher in search results. You're more likely to be found.

---

## SECTION 8: Custom URL & Settings (13:00-14:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, final polish]

Two quick optimizations:

[GRAPHIC: Custom URL]

**1. Customize Your URL**
Default: linkedin.com/in/firstname-lastname-random-numbers
Better: linkedin.com/in/mayachen

Go to Settings → Edit public profile URL → Customize.

[GRAPHIC: Open to Work]

**2. Turn On "Open to Work"**
Go to your profile → Open to → Finding a new job.

You can make this visible to recruiters only (not your current employer) or to everyone.

[VISUAL: Cat, visibility]

Turning on "Open to Work" increases recruiter messages. It signals you're available.

---

## SUMMARY & CTA (14:00-15:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]

[GRAPHIC: Deliverable complete]

**Deliverable: LinkedIn All-Star Profile** ✓
