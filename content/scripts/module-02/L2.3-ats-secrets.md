## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Before your resume ever reaches a human, it goes through a robot.

It's called an ATS — Applicant Tracking System. And 75% of resumes are rejected by ATS before any recruiter ever sees them.

If you've been applying to jobs and hearing nothing back, this might be why. Let me show you how to get through.

## OBJECTIVES (0:45-1:00)

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Understand how ATS systems screen resumes
- Format your resume for ATS compatibility
- Use keywords strategically (without gaming the system)

## SECTION 1: What Is ATS? (1:00-2:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, explaining the system]

ATS stands for Applicant Tracking System. It's software that companies use to manage job applications.

[GRAPHIC: ATS flow diagram]

Here's how it works:
1. You submit your resume online
2. The ATS scans your resume
3. It looks for keywords, qualifications, and formatting
4. It scores or ranks your application
5. Only top-ranked resumes get to human reviewers

[VISUAL: Cat, the reality]

Big companies get hundreds, sometimes thousands of applications per job. They literally can't read them all. So the robot filters first.

[GRAPHIC: Stat callout]

75% of resumes are rejected by ATS. That means only 25% ever get human eyes.

[VISUAL: Cat, good news]

Good news: once you know the rules, it's easy to get through. The robots are predictable.

---

## SECTION 2: Format Rules (2:30-5:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical rules]

Let's start with formatting. ATS systems are picky about how your resume looks.

[GRAPHIC: Format rule 1]

**Rule 1: No Tables or Columns**
ATS can't read multi-column layouts. Your beautifully designed two-column resume? It looks like scrambled nonsense to the robot. Stick to a single column.

[GRAPHIC: Format rule 2]

**Rule 2: No Graphics, Icons, or Images**
That little phone icon next to your number? ATS can't read it. It sees a blank space. Use plain text for everything.

[GRAPHIC: Format rule 3]

**Rule 3: Standard Section Headers**
Use obvious section names: "Experience" not "My Journey." "Education" not "Academic Background." "Skills" not "What I Bring to the Table."

ATS looks for standard headers. Get creative and you disappear.

[GRAPHIC: Format rule 4]

**Rule 4: Standard Fonts**
Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman, Garamond. Nothing fancy. The robot needs to read every character.

[GRAPHIC: Format rule 5]

**Rule 5: Submit as .docx or PDF**
Check the job posting. If they want PDF, send PDF. If they want Word, send .docx. Some ATS struggle with PDFs — when in doubt, .docx is safest.

[VISUAL: Cat, warning]

I've seen amazing resumes get rejected because of fancy formatting. Don't let design sabotage your content.

## SECTION 3: Keywords Strategy (5:00-7:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, keyword importance]

Here's where it gets interesting. ATS scans for keywords that match the job description.

[GRAPHIC: How keywords work]

If a job asks for "customer service experience" and your resume never mentions "customer service" — you might get filtered out, even if you have the experience.

[VISUAL: Cat, the strategy]

Here's how to use keywords effectively:

[GRAPHIC: Strategy 1]

**Step 1: Study the Job Description**
Read it carefully. Highlight the skills, qualifications, and requirements they mention. These are your target keywords.

[GRAPHIC: Strategy 2]

**Step 2: Match Their Language**
If they say "project management," use "project management" — not "managing projects." If they say "customer service," use that exact phrase.

[GRAPHIC: Strategy 3]

**Step 3: Sprinkle Naturally**
Don't just list keywords. Weave them into your bullet points and skills section where they make sense.

[VISUAL: Cat, example]

Job description says: "Looking for someone with customer service experience, attention to detail, and proficiency in Excel."

Your resume should include: "customer service," "attention to detail," and "Excel" — used naturally in context.

[GRAPHIC: Warning callout]

**Warning: Don't keyword stuff.**
Some people try to cram every keyword in white text at the bottom. ATS catch that. Recruiters catch that. It's dishonest and will get you rejected.

[VISUAL: Cat, authenticity check]

The rule: only include keywords for skills you actually have. If you claim Excel proficiency, you better be able to demonstrate it in an interview.

---

## SECTION 4: ATS Checking Tools (7:30-9:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, practical tools]

Now, how do you know if your resume will pass ATS?

[GRAPHIC: Tool recommendations]

**Tool 1: Jobscan (jobscan.co)**
Paste your resume and the job description. It scores your match and tells you what to add.

**Tool 2: Teal (tealhq.com)**
Similar functionality, plus helps you track applications.

**Tool 3: Resume Worded**
Gives ATS compatibility feedback plus general resume scoring.

[VISUAL: Cat, how to use]

Here's the workflow:

1. Find a job you want to apply for
2. Copy the job description
3. Paste your resume into the tool
4. Check your score (aim for 70%+)
5. Adjust your resume to improve the match
6. Recheck
7. Apply

[GRAPHIC: Score target]

If your score is below 70%, you're at risk of being filtered. Add more matching keywords. Adjust your language.

[VISUAL: Cat, time investment]

This takes maybe 10 minutes per application. It sounds like a lot, but sending 100 unoptimized applications gets you nothing. Sending 20 optimized ones gets you interviews.

---

## SECTION 5: The Tailoring Reality (9:00-9:45)

[VISUAL: Cat, honest talk]

Let me be real with you. The days of sending one resume to every job are over.

[GRAPHIC: One resume ≠ Every job]

Every job you apply to should get a slightly tailored resume. Not a completely new resume — just adjusted for keywords and emphasis.

[VISUAL: Cat, practical tip]

Here's what I do:

- Keep a "master resume" with everything
- For each application, copy it
- Add/adjust keywords for that specific job
- Run it through an ATS checker
- Submit

[VISUAL: Cat, encouragement]

Once you have your template, this takes 10-15 minutes per application. That's the real work of job searching. Quality over quantity.
