## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

"Tell me about yourself."

It's the most common interview question. It's also used in every networking conversation. And if you don't have a prepared answer, you're going to ramble.

Today, you're building your 30-second elevator pitch. By the end, you'll have a crisp, confident answer ready to go.

[GRAPHIC: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
- Write a 30-second elevator pitch
- Know how to deliver it naturally (not robotic)
- Be able to adapt it for different situations

## SECTION 1: Why You Need One (1:00-2:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, setting the context]

Let me tell you what happens without a prepared pitch.

[GRAPHIC: The ramble scenario]

Interviewer: "Tell me about yourself."

You: "Um, well, I'm a student at... I'm majoring in business? And I've worked some jobs... Like I was at Target for a while, and before that I was, uh, doing some tutoring... And I guess I'm looking for... like, a real job?"

[VISUAL: Cat, the problem]

That's painful. It makes you seem unprepared. Unclear. Not confident.

Now here's what happens with a pitch:

[GRAPHIC: The polished scenario]

You: "I'm a business administration student at Saint Paul College, graduating this May. Over the past two years, I've developed strong customer service and communication skills through my work at Target, where I've handled high-volume retail operations and trained new team members. I'm now looking to apply those skills in a marketing coordinator role where I can combine my customer insights with my growing interest in digital marketing."

[VISUAL: Cat, the difference]

See the difference? Clear, confident, intentional. You sound like you know what you're doing.

## SECTION 2: The Formula (2:00-4:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, teaching the structure]

Here's the formula that makes this easy.

[GRAPHIC: Present + Past + Future formula]

**Present + Past + Future**

**Present:** Who you are right now
**Past:** Relevant experience and skills
**Future:** What you're looking for

[VISUAL: Cat, breaking it down]

Let me break it down:

[GRAPHIC: Present section]

**Present (1-2 sentences):**
- Your current status (student, recent grad, current role)
- Your school, major, graduation date
- Any notable current activities

"I'm a business administration student at Saint Paul College, graduating this May."

[GRAPHIC: Past section]

**Past (2-3 sentences):**
- Relevant experience
- Key skills developed
- Accomplishments if notable

"Over the past two years, I've developed strong customer service and communication skills through my work at Target, where I've handled high-volume retail operations and trained new team members."

[GRAPHIC: Future section]

**Future (1-2 sentences):**
- What you're looking for
- Why you're interested
- How your past connects to future

"I'm now looking to apply those skills in a marketing coordinator role where I can combine my customer insights with my growing interest in digital marketing."

[VISUAL: Cat, total time]

Total: about 30 seconds. That's the sweet spot.

## SECTION 3: Examples (4:00-6:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, more examples]

Let me give you a few more examples for different situations.

[GRAPHIC: Example 1]

**For a customer success role:**

"I'm currently finishing my associate's degree in communication at Metro College. I've spent the last year working at a call center where I've resolved over a thousand customer issues with a 95% satisfaction rating. I'm looking for a customer success role where I can combine my problem-solving skills with my genuine interest in helping people succeed with products they use."

[GRAPHIC: Example 2]

**For an HR assistant role:**

"I'm a human resource management student at City College, graduating in December. Through my work-study job in the admissions office, I've developed skills in data management, confidentiality, and communication — supporting over 200 student inquiries weekly. I'm seeking an HR assistant position where I can apply my organizational skills and passion for supporting employees."

[GRAPHIC: Example 3]

**For networking (less formal):**

"I'm Maya — I'm finishing up my business degree at Saint Paul College. I've been working in retail customer service, but I'm really interested in moving into marketing. I'd love to learn more about how you got into the field."

[VISUAL: Cat, adaptation note]

Notice how the networking version is shorter and more conversational. You adapt based on the context.

## SECTION 4: Write Yours (6:00-8:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, practice time]

Your turn.

[GRAPHIC: Exercise instructions]

**Step 1:** Write your Present (who you are now)
- Status, school, major, graduation

**Step 2:** Write your Past (what you bring)
- 2-3 key experiences or skills
- Use your transferable skills list for ideas

**Step 3:** Write your Future (what you want)
- The type of role you're seeking
- Why it connects to your past

**Step 4:** Put it together
- Read it out loud
- Should be about 30 seconds
- Adjust until it flows naturally

[GRAPHIC: Pause indicator]

Pause now and write your pitch. Take 5-7 minutes.

[VISUAL: Cat, after pause]

Got it written? Good. Now comes the important part.

## SECTION 5: Practice & Polish (8:00-9:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, delivery matters]

Writing it is half the battle. Delivering it naturally is the other half.

[GRAPHIC: Practice steps]

**Step 1: Say it out loud 10 times**
Not reading — from memory. It should feel natural, not scripted.

**Step 2: Record yourself once**
Listen back. Do you sound confident? Rushed? Robotic?

**Step 3: Practice with someone**
Ask a friend to ask you "Tell me about yourself." Deliver your pitch. Get feedback.

[VISUAL: Cat, common issues]

**Common issues to fix:**
- Too fast → Slow down. Breathe.
- Too robotic → Use conversational tone. It's a story, not a recitation.
- Too long → Cut. 30 seconds max.
- Too vague → Be specific. Names, numbers, concrete examples.

[VISUAL: Cat, important mindset]

It will feel awkward at first. That's normal. The more you practice, the more natural it becomes.

[GRAPHIC: Practice goal]

**Goal:** Be able to deliver it confidently without thinking about the words.
