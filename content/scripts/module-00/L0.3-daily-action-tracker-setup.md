Alright, let's get your first win.

This is simple. It's not complicated. And it works.

## SECTION 1: Why Tracking Matters (0:45-2:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, explaining the concept]

Before we set it up, let me tell you why this matters.

Job searching feels chaotic. You're applying here, networking there, updating your resume, prepping for interviews — and it all blurs together. After a week, you can't remember what you did or what worked.

[GRAPHIC: "The Problem" — scattered activities icon]

That's the problem. Without tracking, you:
- Forget what you've done
- Can't see your progress
- Don't know what's working
- Lose motivation

[VISUAL: Cat, transitioning to solution]

The Daily Action Tracker fixes all of that.

[GRAPHIC: "The Solution" — organized tracker icon]

It takes 5 minutes a day — that's it. You log what you did, note your wins, and over time, you see patterns. You see progress. You see what's actually getting results.

And here's the thing: just the act of tracking makes you more consistent. It's like a fitness app — you do more because you're watching yourself.

## SECTION 2: Getting the Tracker (2:00-3:30)

[VISUAL: Cat transitioning to screencast]

Let me show you how to get it set up.

[SCREENCAST: Course platform/download page]

[ACTION: Navigate to resources section]

First, go to the resources section of this lesson. You'll see a download button for the Daily Action Tracker.

[ACTION: Click download]

Click to download.

[ACTION: Show file options]

You've got two options:
1. **Spreadsheet version** (Google Sheets or Excel) — if you like working on your computer
2. **Printable PDF** — if you prefer paper

Pick whichever works for your style. I'll show you the spreadsheet version, but they work the same way.

[ACTION: Open spreadsheet]

Here's what you're looking at.

## SECTION 3: The Tracker Layout (3:30-5:30)

[SCREENCAST: Walking through the tracker]

[ACTION: Point to Date column]

**Date** — Simple. When did you do this?

[ACTION: Point to Activity Type column]

**Activity Type** — What kind of action was it? Categories include:
- Applied to job
- Networking outreach
- Informational interview
- Resume/LinkedIn update
- Interview prep
- Interview
- Follow-up

[ACTION: Show dropdown or options]

These are pre-filled for you. Just select from the dropdown.

[ACTION: Point to Details column]

**Details** — Quick notes. Company name, person you contacted, what you did.

[ACTION: Point to Result column]

**Result** — What happened? Got a response? Scheduled an interview? Ghosted? All of it goes here.

[ACTION: Point to Wins column]

**Wins** — This is important. Did anything good happen? Even small wins count. Got a reply. Finished a section of this course. Felt good about an application. Write it down.

[VISUAL: Highlight the Wins column]

The wins column is your motivation fuel. On hard days, scroll back and see all the wins you've stacked up. It matters.

---

## SECTION 4: Your First Entry (5:30-7:30)

[SCREENCAST: Filling out first entry]

Let's log your first entry right now.

[ACTION: Type in the Date field]

Today's date. Got it.

[ACTION: Select Activity Type]

Activity type: "Course Progress" — because you're taking action by being here.

[ACTION: Type in Details]

Details: "Started Get Hired Fast course. Completed Launchpad module."

[ACTION: Type in Result]

Result: "Set up Daily Action Tracker."

[ACTION: Type in Wins]

Win: "Took the first step. I'm doing this."

[ACTION: Save/show completed row]

Boom. First entry done.

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera, celebratory]

You just did something 90% of job seekers never do — you started tracking. You're already ahead.

## SECTION 5: Making It a Habit (7:30-9:00)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Now, here's the key: this only works if you use it.

[GRAPHIC: "Daily Habit" icons]

I recommend logging at the end of each day. Takes 5 minutes. Here's what to do:

[GRAPHIC: Step 1]

**Step 1:** Open your tracker.

[GRAPHIC: Step 2]

**Step 2:** Ask yourself: "What job search actions did I take today?"

[GRAPHIC: Step 3]

**Step 3:** Log each action — activity, details, result.

[GRAPHIC: Step 4]

**Step 4:** Write at least one win — even if it's small.

[VISUAL: Cat, practical tip]

Pro tip: Set a daily reminder on your phone. 8pm. "Log your job search." Five minutes, done.

[VISUAL: Cat, motivational]

Some days you'll have five things to log. Some days you'll have one. Both are fine. The point is consistency, not perfection.

And on days when you don't feel like doing anything? Log that too. "Took a rest day." That's honest. That's real. The tracker doesn't judge — it just tracks.

---

## SECTION 6: Weekly Review (9:00-9:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, quick addition]

One more thing: at the end of each week, take 10 minutes to review.

[GRAPHIC: Weekly review questions]

Ask yourself:
- What activities got results?
- What should I do more of?
- What wins am I proud of?

This is where patterns emerge. Maybe you'll notice that networking outreach gets more responses than cold applications. Maybe you'll see that mornings are your most productive time.

The data tells you what works. Then you do more of that.

---

## SUMMARY & CTA (9:30-10:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, wrapping up]

That's it. You've got your tracker. You've logged your first entry. You're in motion.

[GRAPHIC: Deliverable checklist]

Here's what you just accomplished:
- Daily Action Tracker: Set up

[VISUAL: Cat, encouraging]

You're ready. Launchpad is complete.

[GRAPHIC: "Next: Career GPS — Problem 1"]
