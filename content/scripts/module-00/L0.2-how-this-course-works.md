## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera]

Before we dive in, let me show you exactly how this course works — because it's not like other courses you've taken.

Most career courses are organized by weeks: "Week 1 do this, Week 2 do that." But here's the thing — you don't wake up thinking "It's Week 3!" You wake up thinking "I have an interview tomorrow, what do I do?"

That's why this course is organized differently.

## SECTION 1: The 6 Problems (0:45-2:00)

[VISUAL: Cat with graphic appearing alongside]

This course is organized around 6 real problems you'll face in your job search.

[GRAPHIC: Problem 1 appears]

**Problem 1: "WTF should I do with my life?"** — Career direction, figuring out what you want, identifying your skills.

[GRAPHIC: Problem 2 appears]

**Problem 2: "My resume has nothing on it"** — Building your resume and LinkedIn when experience feels thin.

[GRAPHIC: Problem 3 appears]

**Problem 3: "I don't know anyone"** — Networking without feeling fake, tapping into the hidden job market.

[GRAPHIC: Problem 4 appears]

**Problem 4: "Help! I have an interview"** — Interview prep, the STAR method, crushing common questions.

[GRAPHIC: Problem 5 appears]

**Problem 5: "Can I actually ask for more?"** — Salary negotiation, even at entry level.

[GRAPHIC: Problem 6 appears]

**Problem 6: "I'm not good enough"** — Conquering imposter syndrome and the mental game.

[VISUAL: Back to Cat]

Here's the key: you can tackle these in any order based on what you need right now.

## SECTION 2: Learning Paths (2:00-3:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, explaining different approaches]

Let me give you some examples.

[GRAPHIC: "Interview Emergency" path]

**Got an interview coming up?** Start with Problem 4 — Interview Intel. Then backfill the others later.

[GRAPHIC: "Resume First" path]

**Need application materials before anything else?** Start with Problem 2 — Brand Builder.

[GRAPHIC: "Mindset First" path]

**Feeling paralyzed by anxiety?** Start with Problem 6 — Inner Game. Get your head right, then tackle tactics.

[VISUAL: Back to Cat]

There's no wrong way to do this. The course serves you — not the other way around.

The recommended path is to go in order, 1 through 6, if you're starting fresh. But you have options.

## SECTION 3: Your Secret Weapon (3:00-4:15)

[VISUAL: Cat, leaning in with emphasis]

Now, here's the thing that makes this course different from just watching videos.

[GRAPHIC: Daily Action Tracker preview]

It's called the Daily Action Tracker.

Every successful job seeker I've worked with has one thing in common: they take consistent action and track what's working.

The Daily Action Tracker is a simple tool — takes 5 minutes a day — where you:
- Log what you did
- Track your wins
- See what's actually working

[VISUAL: Back to Cat]

It sounds basic, but it's transformational. When you can see your progress, you stay motivated. When you track what's working, you do more of it.

In the next video, I'll help you set it up. It's your first deliverable — and it takes about 10 minutes.

## SECTION 4: How Videos Work (4:15-4:45)

[VISUAL: Cat, quick practical info]

Quick practical stuff:

[GRAPHIC: Icons for video length, worksheets, action items]

- Videos are **10-15 minutes max** — designed for busy schedules
- Each video has **downloadable resources** — worksheets, templates, scripts
- Every lesson ends with a **clear action item** — you'll always know what to do next

No fluff. No filler. Just the good stuff.
