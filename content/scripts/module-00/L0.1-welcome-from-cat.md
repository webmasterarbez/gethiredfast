## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[VISUAL: Cat direct-to-camera, warm professional setting]

Hey! I'm Cat Breet, and I'm so glad you're here.

Let me guess — you're looking for a job, you're probably a little overwhelmed, and you're wondering if this course is actually going to help or if it's just more generic career advice that doesn't apply to you.

I get it. And I'm going to be straight with you from the start.

## OBJECTIVES (0:30-0:45)

- Why you can do this

## SECTION 1: Why Listen to Me (0:45-2:00)

[VISUAL: Cat speaking, occasional B-roll of professional environments]

Here's the thing about most career advice: it's written by people who've never actually hired anyone. They read some articles, maybe talked to a recruiter once, and now they're experts.

That's not me.

[B-ROLL: Office environments, interview settings]

I've spent 22 years on the hiring side. I've reviewed over 10,000 resumes. I've interviewed thousands of candidates. I've said "yes" and I've said "no" — a lot of both.

[VISUAL: Back to Cat]

I know what makes a recruiter's eyes light up. I know what makes us put your resume in the "no" pile after 7 seconds. I know the exact mistakes people make in interviews that cost them the job.

And I'm going to tell you all of it.

Think of me as your friend who works inside the restaurant and can tell you what's actually good — not just what the menu says. I've been behind the curtain. I know how this works.

## SECTION 2: The Promise (2:00-3:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, engaged and direct]

So what can this course actually do for you?

Here's the reality: the national average time to find a job is 22 weeks. That's five and a half months of stress, uncertainty, and wondering if you're doing something wrong.

[GRAPHIC: "22 weeks → 10 weeks | 55% Faster"]

My students? They average 10 weeks or less. That's 55% faster than average.

[VISUAL: Back to Cat]

And that's not magic. It's not luck. It's method.

You're going to learn exactly what I've learned in 22 years — the insider tricks, the psychology of hiring, the exact words to say. You'll build the materials that get you in the door. You'll practice the skills that get you the offer.

[B-ROLL: Student celebrating, professional handshake]

This works. And I've seen it work for students just like you — community college students, people working part-time, folks who thought their resume was "too thin" to compete.

## SECTION 3: This Is For You (3:30-4:30)

[VISUAL: Cat, warm and understanding]

Speaking of which — this course is specifically designed for where you are right now.

I know you're probably balancing school and work. I know your resume might feel empty. I know you might not have connections in your field yet. I know imposter syndrome might be whispering that you don't belong in the job you want.

[GRAPHIC: "Built for Community College Students"]

I built this for exactly that. Not recycled advice for executives or tech workers. Real strategies for students with real lives and real constraints.

[VISUAL: Cat, leaning in slightly]

And here's what I want you to know: I've got your back. Every video, every worksheet, every template — it's designed to make your job search easier, faster, and less stressful.

## SUMMARY & CTA (4:30-5:00)

[VISUAL: Cat, encouraging smile]

So here's the deal: you've already taken the hardest step. You showed up. You pressed play. Most people never get this far.

[GRAPHIC: "Next up: How This Course Works"]

In the next video, I'll show you exactly how this course works so you can hit the ground running.

[VISUAL: Cat, direct eye contact]

You can do this. The job is out there. Let's go get it.
