  # QUALITY CRITERIA
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  quality_criteria:

    - name: "Specificity"
      weight: 35
      description: "Plan has specific, measurable targets"
      levels:
        4: |
          Exemplary: All targets are specific numbers. "Apply to 10 jobs
          per week" not "apply to jobs." Weekly checkpoints defined.
          Clear metrics for success.
        3: |
          Proficient: Most targets are specific. Some vague areas but
          generally measurable.
        2: |
          Developing: Mix of specific and vague targets. Hard to measure
          progress in some areas.
        1: |
          Beginning: Mostly vague goals. "Apply more" or "network better"
          without specifics.

    - name: "Realism"
      weight: 30
      description: "Plan is achievable given student's situation"
      levels:
        4: |
          Exemplary: Targets account for work/school schedule. Sustainable
          pace. Not too ambitious or too conservative. Student can explain
          why targets are realistic.
        3: |
          Proficient: Generally realistic. Minor adjustments might be needed.
          Most activities are sustainable.
        2: |
          Developing: Some targets unrealistic or too conservative. May
          need significant adjustment.
        1: |
          Beginning: Wildly ambitious or so conservative it won't produce
          results. Doesn't account for real constraints.

    - name: "Comprehensiveness"
      weight: 20
      description: "Plan covers all key job search activities"
      levels:
        4: |
          Exemplary: Includes applications, networking, follow-up, skill
          building, and mental health. Addresses multiple channels. Has
          contingency for setbacks.
        3: |
          Proficient: Covers main activities. Most channels addressed.
          Minor gaps.
        2: |
          Developing: Focuses on one or two activities. Missing key areas.
          No backup plan.
        1: |
          Beginning: Only covers applications or only covers networking.
          Major gaps in strategy.

    - name: "Integration"
      weight: 15
      description: "Uses course deliverables and tools"
      levels:
        4: |
          Exemplary: Plan explicitly references and uses: Daily Action
          Tracker, resume, LinkedIn, STAR stories, network map, research
          templates. Course tools integrated into workflow.
        3: |
          Proficient: Most course tools referenced. Clear intention to use
          deliverables created.
        2: |
          Developing: Some course tools mentioned but integration unclear.
          May rely on outside tools instead.
        1: |
          Beginning: Doesn't reference course deliverables. Seems disconnected
          from course learning.
