      levels:
        4: |
          Exemplary: Headline clearly states target role or value proposition.
          Includes keywords recruiters search for. Compelling and specific.
          Example: "Marketing Coordinator | Social Media Strategy | Data-Driven Campaigns"
        3: |
          Proficient: Headline indicates target role. Some keywords included.
          Clear but could be more compelling.
        2: |
          Developing: Headline is vague or generic. Missing keywords.
          Doesn't clearly communicate target.
        1: |

          indication of what you're seeking.

          without adaptation.

    - name: "Experience Descriptions"

          Quantified results where possible. Skills clearly demonstrated.
          Reads differently than resume (more narrative).
        3: |
          Proficient: Most positions highlight achievements. Some
          quantification. Clear skills demonstration.
        2: |

          issues with lighting or background.
        2: |
