# =============================================================================
# PROBLEM-CENTERED
# =============================================================================

problem_context: |
  Community college students consistently undervalue their experience. They
  say "I was just a cashier" or "I only did group projects" without realizing
  these experiences developed real, marketable skills. This limiting belief
  leads to weak resumes and low confidence.

  The real problem: "I don't think I have any skills worth mentioning."

# ACTIVATION
# =============================================================================

activation:
  prior_knowledge: |
    - They've had part-time jobs, even if not "professional"
    - They've completed school projects and assignments
    - They've helped family, friends, or community
    - They've learned things on their own (hobbies, interests)
    - They know what "skills" means in general

  connection: |
    "Think about the last time someone asked you for help with something.
    Maybe a friend needed tech support. Maybe you helped organize an event.
    That thing you did so easily? That's a skill. You just don't see it
    because it comes naturally to you."

  analogy: |
    Like a fish asking "What's water?" — your skills are so natural to
    you that you don't notice them. We're going to help you see what's
    been invisible.

# =============================================================================
# DEMONSTRATION
# =============================================================================

demonstration:
  key_concepts:
    - concept: "Transferable skills"
      explanation: |
        Skills that apply across different jobs and industries. Communication,
        problem-solving, teamwork, organization — these matter everywhere.
        You don't need industry-specific experience to have valuable skills.
      example: |
        "Managing a busy register during lunch rush taught you: multitasking,
        customer service, working under pressure, accuracy with money, conflict
        resolution. That's 5 skills from one 'basic' job."

    - concept: "Everything counts"
      explanation: |
        Skills come from everywhere: jobs, school, volunteering, family
        responsibilities, hobbies, self-teaching. None of these are "too
        small" to matter.
      example: |
        "Helped your younger sibling with homework? That's tutoring,
        patience, and communication. Organized the family reunion?
        That's event planning, coordination, and leadership."

    - concept: "Translation is the key"
      explanation: |
        The skill isn't different — just the language. Professional language
        makes the same experience sound more impressive (and it IS impressive).
      example: |
        Before: "Helped customers find stuff"
        After: "Provided product recommendations and personalized customer
        service, increasing customer satisfaction"

  worked_examples:
    - scenario: "Transforming 'cashier' experience"
      steps:
        - "Start with the job title: Cashier at Target"
        - "List what you actually DID: handled transactions, answered questions, stocked shelves, trained new hires"
        - "Translate each task to a skill: cash handling accuracy, customer service, inventory management, training/mentorship"
        - "Add impact when possible: '200+ transactions daily with 99% accuracy'"
      outcome: |
        "Cashier" becomes: Customer service, cash handling, attention to
        detail, working under pressure, training others

    - scenario: "Transforming 'group project' experience"
      steps:
        - "Start with the project: Marketing plan for local business"
        - "List your role: researched competitors, presented findings, coordinated team schedules"
        - "Translate to skills: market research, public speaking, team coordination, project management"
        - "Add result: 'Presented to client who implemented 3 recommendations'"
      outcome: |
        "School project" becomes: Research, presentation, teamwork,
        client interaction, real-world impact

    - scenario: "Transforming 'family responsibility' experience"
      steps:
        - "Start with responsibility: Managed household while mom worked"
        - "List what you did: budgeting, scheduling, sibling care, cooking"
        - "Translate: Financial management, time management, supervision, resourcefulness"
        - "Quantify: 'Managed household budget of $X/month'"
      outcome: |
        "Family stuff" becomes: Budget management, scheduling,
        supervision, problem-solving, responsibility

  non_examples:
    - what: "Underselling: 'I was just a cashier'"
      why_wrong: |
        "Just" minimizes real skills. Cashiers handle money, serve customers,
        multitask, and solve problems. That's valuable.

    - what: "Overstating: 'I was basically the manager'"
      why_wrong: |
        Exaggeration backfires in interviews. Be honest about your role
        while still claiming the real skills you developed.

    - what: "Ignoring non-work experience"
      why_wrong: |
        School projects, volunteer work, and personal experiences all develop
        skills. Limiting to "official" jobs undersells you.

# =============================================================================
# APPLICATION
# =============================================================================

application:
  guided:
    - activity: "Transform one experience together"
      scaffolding: |
        Cat walks through one common CC student experience (retail job,
        food service, or school project) using the transformation process.
        Students follow along with their own example.
      feedback: |
        "If you came up with 3+ skills from one experience, you're on track.
        Most people have 10+ experiences to mine."

  independent:
    - activity: "Complete Transferable Skills Inventory"
      success_criteria: |
        Student identifies 10+ transferable skills from at least 5 different
        experiences (jobs, school, personal). Each skill has a source
        experience documented.

# =============================================================================
# INTEGRATION
# =============================================================================

integration:
  reflection: |
    "Which skill surprised you the most? The one you didn't realize you
    had until you went through this exercise?"

  transfer: |
    These skills become the foundation for resume bullet points, interview
    answers, and LinkedIn content. Students will reference this list
    throughout the course.

  share: |
    "Ask someone who knows you: 'What do you think I'm good at?' Their
    answer might reveal skills you've overlooked."

# INSTRUCTOR NOTES
# =============================================================================

instructor_notes:
  tone: |
    Eye-opening and encouraging. The goal is an "aha" moment where students
    realize they have more to offer than they thought. Enthusiastic about
    their potential.

  key_moments:
    - "The 'cashier' transformation demo is the centerpiece"
    - "Pause for students to try their own translation"
    - "Affirm that everything counts"
    - "Quantifying makes skills tangible"

  avoid:
    - "Making it seem like you need impressive experiences"
    - "Rushing through the transformation process"
    - "Focusing only on work (include school, personal)"

  visual_suggestions:
    - "Before/after split screen for transformations"
    - "Skills emerging from common experiences (visual)"
    - "10+ skills on screen to show the abundance"
