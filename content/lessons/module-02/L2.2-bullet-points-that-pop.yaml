# =============================================================================
# PROBLEM-CENTERED
# =============================================================================

problem_context: |
  Most student resumes read like job descriptions, not achievement showcases.
  They list duties ("Responsible for customer service") instead of impact
  ("Resolved 50+ customer inquiries daily with 95% satisfaction rate").
  Recruiters scan for impact, not duties — so these resumes get skipped.

  The real problem: "My resume describes what I did, but doesn't show why
  it mattered."

# =============================================================================
# ACTIVATION
# =============================================================================

activation:
  prior_knowledge: |
    - They've seen resume bullet points before
    - They understand the concept of achievements vs. tasks
    - They have transferable skills identified (from Module 1)
    - They know verbs and nouns (basic grammar)

  connection: |
    "Think about two people at the same job. One is amazing, one is mediocre.
    On paper, their job descriptions are identical. The difference? What they
    accomplished — the RESULTS. That's what we need to show."

  analogy: |
    Job description = recipe ingredients
    Resume bullet = the dish you created
    Anyone can buy ingredients. Show what you cooked.

# =============================================================================
# DEMONSTRATION
# =============================================================================

demonstration:
  key_concepts:
    - concept: "Achievement vs. Task"
      explanation: |
        Tasks describe what you were supposed to do (the job description).
        Achievements describe what you actually accomplished (your unique
        contribution). Recruiters scan for achievements.
      example: |
        Task: "Responsible for answering customer calls"
        Achievement: "Resolved 50+ customer inquiries daily, reducing
        average call time by 20% through improved troubleshooting process"

    - concept: "The XYZ Formula"
      explanation: |
        Accomplished X by doing Y, resulting in Z.
        X = What you achieved (start with action verb)
        Y = How you did it (your method)
        Z = The result/impact (quantify when possible)
      example: |
        "Trained 5 new team members (X) by creating a step-by-step onboarding
        guide (Y), reducing training time from 2 weeks to 5 days (Z)"

    - concept: "Quantification"
      explanation: |
        Numbers make achievements concrete and believable. They don't have
        to be exact — estimates are fine. If you can't quantify, describe
        scale or scope.
      example: |
        Weak: "Served many customers"
        Better: "Served 100+ customers daily"
        Best: "Served 100+ customers daily during peak holiday season,
        maintaining 4.8/5 satisfaction rating"

    - concept: "Action Verbs"
      explanation: |
        Start every bullet with a strong action verb. Avoid passive language
        ("Responsible for," "Helped with," "Was involved in").
      example: |
        Weak: "Was responsible for inventory"
        Strong: "Managed inventory for 2,000+ SKUs, reducing stockouts by 30%"

  worked_examples:
    - scenario: "Transforming a cashier bullet point"
      steps:
        - "Original: 'Responsible for cash register'"
        - "Identify the achievement: What did you actually DO well?"
        - "Add method: HOW did you do it?"
        - "Quantify: Numbers, percentages, frequency"
        - "Result: 'Processed $10,000+ in daily transactions with 99.8% accuracy, selected to train new hires on POS system'"
      outcome: |
        From job description to achievement showcase. Same job, 10x
        more impressive.

    - scenario: "Transforming a group project bullet"
      steps:
        - "Original: 'Worked on marketing project'"
        - "Identify role: What was YOUR specific contribution?"
        - "Add method: What approach did you take?"
        - "Add result: What happened because of your work?"
        - "Result: 'Led competitive analysis for marketing strategy project, presenting findings to client who implemented 3 of 5 recommendations'"
      outcome: |
        From vague participation to demonstrated leadership and impact.

    - scenario: "Quantifying when you don't have exact numbers"
      steps:
        - "Original: 'Helped customers find products'"
        - "Estimate frequency: How many per day/week/shift?"
        - "Estimate scope: How large was the store/section?"
        - "Think about outcomes: Upsells? Satisfaction? Return customers?"
        - "Result: 'Provided personalized product recommendations to 40+ customers per shift, contributing to department's 15% increase in accessory sales'"
      outcome: |
        Even without exact metrics, reasonable estimates create credibility.

  non_examples:
    - what: "Passive language: 'Was responsible for...'"
      why_wrong: |
        "Was responsible for" is what the JOB required. It says nothing
        about what YOU accomplished. Start with action verbs.

    - what: "Listing duties: 'Answered phones, filed documents, attended meetings'"
      why_wrong: |
        This is a job description, not an achievement list. Every person
        in that role did these things. What made YOU stand out?

    - what: "Vague claims: 'Excellent customer service skills'"
      why_wrong: |
        This is an opinion, not evidence. Show don't tell. Prove it with
        specific examples and results.

    - what: "Exaggeration: 'Revolutionized the entire company'"
      why_wrong: |
        Exaggeration destroys credibility. Be honest about scope while
        still claiming your real accomplishments.

# =============================================================================
# APPLICATION
# =============================================================================

application:
  guided:
    - activity: "Transform one bullet together"
      scaffolding: |
        Cat takes a common weak bullet and transforms it live, explaining
        each decision. Students write along with their own experience.
      feedback: |
        "Your bullet should now start with an action verb, include
        at least one number, and show a result. If it doesn't, revise."

    - activity: "Use the XYZ formula"
      scaffolding: |
        Provide the formula template. Students fill in X, Y, and Z
        from their own experience.
      feedback: |
        "Read it out loud. Does it sound like a real accomplishment?
        Would you be impressed if someone else said it in an interview?"

  independent:
    - activity: "Write 5 achievement bullets"
      success_criteria: |
        5 bullet points that:
        - Start with action verb
        - Describe achievements (not duties)
        - Include at least one quantifiable element
        - Show impact/result

# =============================================================================
# INTEGRATION
# =============================================================================

integration:
  reflection: |
    "Which bullet are you most proud of? Which one makes you think
    'I actually DID accomplish something'?"

  transfer: |
    These bullets become the core of the resume. The same achievements
    become STAR stories for interviews. The language carries forward
    throughout the job search.

  share: |
    "Read your bullets to someone who knows your work. Ask: 'Does this
    sound like what I actually did?' Their reaction tells you if it's
    authentic and impressive."

# INSTRUCTOR NOTES
# =============================================================================

instructor_notes:
  tone: |
    Teaching and demonstrating. This is a skill lesson — students need to
    SEE transformations happen, not just hear about them. Live transformation
    demos are the heart of this lesson.

  key_moments:
    - "The before/after transformation (show the magic)"
    - "XYZ formula introduction (give them a tool)"
    - "Quantification tips (solve their biggest excuse)"
    - "Practice during the lesson (not just after)"

  avoid:
    - "Only showing perfect examples (show messy transformations)"
    - "Moving too fast (students need to write along)"
    - "Forgetting non-work experiences (use school/personal too)"

  visual_suggestions:
    - "Split screen: weak bullet → strong bullet"
    - "XYZ formula as persistent graphic"
    - "Action verb list on screen"
    - "Live transformation with highlighting"
