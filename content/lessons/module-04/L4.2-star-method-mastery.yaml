# =============================================================================
# PROBLEM-CENTERED
# =============================================================================

problem_context: |
  "Tell me about a time when..." questions are the most common interview
  format, and students consistently fail them. They ramble, give vague
  answers, or freeze up. Without a structure, even good experiences come
  across poorly.

  The real problem: "I have experiences, but I can't communicate them
  clearly under pressure."

# =============================================================================
# ACTIVATION
# =============================================================================

activation:
  prior_knowledge: |
    - They've heard of "behavioral interviews" even if they don't know details
    - They have experiences to draw from (identified in Module 1)
    - They know how to tell stories (everyone does, informally)
    - They may have bombed an interview answer before

  connection: |
    "Have you ever been asked 'Tell me about yourself' and rambled for
    5 minutes? Or been asked about a challenge and blanked? There's a
    formula that prevents both. It's called STAR."

  analogy: |
    STAR is like a recipe for story-telling. Just like a recipe has
    ingredients in order (flour before eggs before milk), STAR has
    elements in order. Follow the recipe, get a good result every time.

# =============================================================================
# DEMONSTRATION
# =============================================================================

demonstration:
  key_concepts:
    - concept: "STAR Framework"
      explanation: |
        S - Situation: Set the scene (who, what, where, when)
        T - Task: What was your specific responsibility?
        A - Action: What did YOU do? (longest part)
        R - Result: What happened? What was the outcome?
      example: |
        S: "Last semester, our marketing group project had a team member drop out 2 weeks before the deadline."
        T: "As project lead, I needed to redistribute the work and keep us on track."
        A: "I held an emergency meeting, reassigned tasks based on strengths, created a compressed timeline, and took on extra research myself."
        R: "We delivered on time and received the highest grade in the class. Professor used our project as an example for future students."

    - concept: "Action is the star of STAR"
      explanation: |
        The most common mistake is spending too much time on Situation/Task
        and not enough on Action. Interviewers want to hear what YOU did,
        specifically. The Action section should be 50-60% of your answer.
      example: |
        Weak Action: "I helped the team."
        Strong Action: "I organized daily check-ins, created a shared tracking document, personally took on the competitor analysis section, and coordinated with the professor to confirm our adjusted scope."

    - concept: "Quantified Results"
      explanation: |
        Results should be specific and quantified when possible. Numbers,
        percentages, or concrete outcomes. If you can't quantify, describe
        the qualitative impact.
      example: |
        Weak: "It worked out well"
        Strong: "We finished 2 days early, scored 98/100, and the client implemented 3 of our 5 recommendations"

    - concept: "The 2-minute rule"
      explanation: |
        A STAR answer should be 1.5-2.5 minutes. Shorter feels incomplete.
        Longer loses attention. Practice until you hit this range naturally.
      example: |
        - Situation/Task: 30 seconds
        - Action: 60-90 seconds
        - Result: 30 seconds

  worked_examples:
    - scenario: "Teamwork question: 'Tell me about a time you worked on a team'"
      steps:
        - "S: 'In my retail job, our store was preparing for Black Friday — our biggest sales day.'"
        - "T: 'I was responsible for coordinating the team's break schedule and floor coverage.'"
        - "A: 'I created a visual schedule, communicated changes via group text, covered for teammates who needed flexibility, and handled escalated customer issues so others could focus.'"
        - "R: 'We hit 120% of our sales goal with zero coverage gaps. Manager recognized our section as best-performing in the store.'"
      outcome: |
        Specific, action-focused, quantified result. Demonstrates teamwork,
        coordination, and impact.

    - scenario: "Problem-solving: 'Tell me about a challenge you overcame'"
      steps:
        - "S: 'My family had a financial emergency and I had to increase my work hours while maintaining my grades.'"
        - "T: 'I needed to work 30+ hours while taking 15 credits and passing all classes.'"
        - "A: 'I negotiated a flexible schedule with my manager, used time-blocking to protect study hours, formed a study group for my hardest class, and communicated with professors about my situation.'"
        - "R: 'I maintained my GPA, got promoted at work, and learned time management skills I use to this day.'"
      outcome: |
        Shows resilience, problem-solving, communication — without oversharing
        personal details. Ends on growth.

    - scenario: "Conflict: 'Tell me about a disagreement with a colleague'"
      steps:
        - "S: 'In a group project, one team member wasn't contributing equally.'"
        - "T: 'As one of the active members, I needed to address it without damaging the team dynamic.'"
        - "A: 'I had a private conversation, used "I" statements, asked about their situation, discovered they were overwhelmed in another class, and we reassigned tasks to play to strengths.'"
        - "R: 'They delivered their new portion well, we finished with an A, and they thanked me for the conversation. We're still friends.'"
      outcome: |
        Shows emotional intelligence, conflict resolution, and positive outcome.

  non_examples:
    - what: "Too much Situation, not enough Action"
      why_wrong: |
        "So there was this project, and the professor assigned groups, and
        our group had five people, and one person never showed up to
        meetings..." — 90 seconds in and we haven't heard what YOU did.

    - what: "Vague Action: 'We worked together'"
      why_wrong: |
        "We" doesn't tell the interviewer what YOU did. They're hiring
        YOU, not your team. Be specific about YOUR contribution.

    - what: "No Result or weak result"
      why_wrong: |
        "And then the project was done" isn't a result. What HAPPENED?
        What was the grade, the outcome, the impact, the learning?

    - what: "Over-sharing personal details"
      why_wrong: |
        "My parents were getting divorced and my brother was sick..."
        — Too personal. Keep it professional and focused on your actions.

# =============================================================================
# APPLICATION
# =============================================================================

application:
  guided:
    - activity: "Build one STAR story together"
      scaffolding: |
        Cat provides a prompt ("Tell me about a time you helped a customer").
        Students fill in each STAR component for their own experience.
        Cat shares example alongside.
      feedback: |
        "Read your Action section. Count how many specific things YOU did.
        If it's less than 3, expand. If it's more than 6, tighten."

    - activity: "Time your answer"
      scaffolding: |
        Set a timer. Students practice their STAR story out loud, aiming
        for 2 minutes.
      feedback: |
        "Under 90 seconds? Add more Action detail. Over 3 minutes? Cut
        Situation setup. The sweet spot is 2 minutes."

  independent:
    - activity: "Complete STAR Story Bank (5+ stories)"
      success_criteria: |
        5+ STAR stories covering different competencies:
        - Teamwork
        - Problem-solving
        - Leadership/initiative
        - Overcoming a challenge
        - Customer/stakeholder interaction
        Each story follows STAR format with quantified results.

# =============================================================================
# INTEGRATION
# =============================================================================

integration:
  reflection: |
    "Which story surprised you with how good it sounds? Sometimes our
    most ordinary experiences become impressive when structured well."

  transfer: |
    These 5+ stories become a reusable toolkit. Multiple interview questions
    can be answered with the same story, slightly adapted. One strong story
    can answer 10 different questions.

  share: |
    "Practice your stories with a friend. Have them ask common questions
    and you respond with STAR. Their feedback helps you refine."

# INSTRUCTOR NOTES
# =============================================================================

instructor_notes:
  tone: |
    Teaching and coaching. This is a skill that requires practice. Be
    encouraging when stories are weak — they'll get better with structure.
    Make STAR feel like a safety net, not a restriction.

  key_moments:
    - "The framework introduction (visual, memorable)"
    - "Action is the STAR of STAR (emphasize loudly)"
    - "Live example walkthrough"
    - "2-minute timing guideline"

  avoid:
    - "Making it seem like you need extraordinary experiences"
    - "Memorizing scripts (it's a structure, not a script)"
    - "Moving on before students try it themselves"

  visual_suggestions:
    - "STAR as a graphic (persistent on screen)"
    - "Pie chart showing time allocation (50-60% action)"
    - "Example story with S/T/A/R labeled"
    - "Timer on screen during practice"
