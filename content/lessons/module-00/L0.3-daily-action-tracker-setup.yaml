# =============================================================================
# PROBLEM-CENTERED
# =============================================================================

problem_context: |
  Job searching is a marathon that most people run like a sprint — then quit.
  The #1 reason job searches fail isn't lack of skills or experience — it's
  loss of momentum. Students start strong, get discouraged, and stop taking
  consistent action.

  The real problem: "How do I stay consistent when motivation fades and
  rejection piles up?"

# =============================================================================
# ACTIVATION
# =============================================================================

activation:
  prior_knowledge: |
    - They've likely started job searches before and lost momentum
    - They understand habit tracking concepts (fitness, studying, etc.)
    - They've experienced the "motivation fade" phenomenon
    - They know accountability helps but don't have systems

  connection: |
    "Have you ever started something with great energy, then slowly drifted
    away? Job searching is especially prone to this. Let me show you how
    to prevent that."

  analogy: |
    Like a step counter or calorie tracker — you can't improve what you
    don't measure. The Daily Action Tracker makes your job search visible
    so you can see what's working and stay consistent.

# =============================================================================
# DEMONSTRATION
# =============================================================================

demonstration:
  key_concepts:
    - concept: "Consistency beats intensity"
      explanation: |
        One action per day for 30 days beats 30 actions in one day followed
        by burnout. The tracker is designed for sustainable, daily action.
      example: |
        "Even on your worst day, log one action. Read a job posting.
        Update one resume line. Send one LinkedIn connection. That counts.
        The streak matters more than the size of the action."

    - concept: "Activity visibility"
      explanation: |
        When you track activities, you can see patterns. What actions lead
        to interviews? What's not working? Data beats guessing.
      example: |
        "After 2 weeks, you'll see: 'I sent 15 networking messages and got
        5 responses. I applied to 10 jobs and got 0 callbacks.' Now you
        know networking is working better than cold applications."

    - concept: "Win celebration"
      explanation: |
        The tracker includes a place to celebrate wins — even small ones.
        This builds positive momentum and reinforces action.
      example: |
        "Got a response to a networking message? That's a win. Finished your
        resume draft? Win. Had a coffee chat? Big win. Log them all."

  worked_examples:
    - scenario: "Setting up the tracker"
      steps:
        - "Download the Google Sheets or Excel version"
        - "Make a copy (Google) or save to your device (Excel)"
        - "Enter today's date"
        - "Log your first action: 'Watched course introduction'"
        - "That's it — you've started"
      outcome: "Student has a functioning tracker with first entry logged"

    - scenario: "Daily tracker routine (what it looks like)"
      steps:
        - "Morning: Open tracker, review yesterday's actions"
        - "Set intention: 'Today I will...' (1-3 actions)"
        - "Evening: Log what you actually did"
        - "Note any wins or insights"
        - "Close out (2-3 minutes total)"
      outcome: "Sustainable daily habit that takes minimal time"

  non_examples:
    - what: "Only logging when you do 'big' things"
      why_wrong: |
        Small actions compound. If you only log big things, you'll feel
        like you're not making progress when you are.

    - what: "Using the tracker to beat yourself up"
      why_wrong: |
        The tracker is for awareness, not judgment. A day with one small
        action is infinitely better than zero days tracked.

    - what: "Waiting until you have 'time' to set it up"
      why_wrong: |
        It takes 2 minutes. The delay is resistance, not reality.

# =============================================================================
# APPLICATION
# =============================================================================

application:
  guided:
    - activity: "Download and set up tracker together"
      scaffolding: |
        Walk through each step on screen. Students follow along in real time.
        Pause for them to complete each step before moving on.
      feedback: |
        "If you're following along, you should now see your first entry.
        Congratulations — you've just done more than 80% of job seekers."

    - activity: "Log first entry"
      scaffolding: |
        Show exactly where to enter the first action.
        Provide the text: "Watched Get Hired Fast introduction"
      feedback: |
        "You've taken your first tracked action. That's not nothing — that's
        the start of a habit that changes everything."

  independent:
    - activity: "Commit to 7 days of tracking"
      success_criteria: |
        Student makes a mental (or written) commitment to log at least
        one action daily for the next 7 days. Ideally posts the tracker
        somewhere visible.

# =============================================================================
# INTEGRATION
# =============================================================================

integration:
  reflection: |
    "What time of day works best for you to log your actions?
    Morning intention-setting or evening reflection? Choose one and
    commit to it."

  transfer: |
    The tracker becomes the backbone of the entire job search. Students
    will reference it throughout the course and continue using it after
    completion until they're hired.

  share: |
    "Want accountability? Text a friend: 'I'm tracking my job search daily
    for the next 30 days. Check in with me next week.'"

# INSTRUCTOR NOTES
# =============================================================================

instructor_notes:
  tone: |
    Encouraging but firm on the importance. This isn't optional — it's
    the system that makes everything else work. Get them to actually do
    it, not just understand it.

  key_moments:
    - "Acknowledge the 'this seems simple' objection"
    - "Make them actually download during the lesson"
    - "First entry logged before lesson ends"
    - "Commitment to 7 days (achievable milestone)"

  avoid:
    - "Making it seem complicated"
    - "Over-explaining the scoring system"
    - "Letting them 'do it later' — do it NOW"

  visual_suggestions:
    - "Screen share of actual tracker"
    - "Demo of entering an action"
    - "Example of 7-day filled tracker"
    - "Win celebration section highlight"
