# =============================================================================
# PROBLEM-CENTERED
# =============================================================================

problem_context: |
  Students need to understand how to navigate this course so they can use
  it effectively. The problem-centered structure is different from typical
  courses — they can jump to what they need most. Without orientation,
  they might get lost or follow the wrong path for their situation.

  The real problem: "How do I use this course in a way that actually helps
  MY specific situation?"

# =============================================================================
# ACTIVATION
# =============================================================================

activation:
  prior_knowledge: |
    - They've taken online courses before (often with low completion)
    - They understand the concept of modules and lessons
    - They know their own pain points (even if not articulated)
    - They're familiar with self-paced learning

  connection: |
    Connect to their experience of feeling lost in other courses or not
    knowing what to do first. "This course is different — it's organized
    around YOUR problems, not arbitrary weeks."

  analogy: |
    Like a choose-your-own-adventure book or a GPS — you tell it where
    you need to go, and it guides you there. The course adapts to your
    immediate needs.

# =============================================================================
# DEMONSTRATION
# =============================================================================

demonstration:
  key_concepts:
    - concept: "Problem-centered structure"
      explanation: |
        The course is organized around 6 problems students actually face,
        not arbitrary "Week 1, Week 2" divisions. This means students can
        jump to what they need most.
      example: |
        "If you have an interview tomorrow, go straight to Module 4.
        If your resume is the problem, start with Module 2. You're in
        control of your path."

    - concept: "The 6 core problems"
      explanation: |
        Quick overview of what each module solves so students can
        identify their starting point.
      example: |
        Visual overview showing:
        1. Career direction confusion
        2. Empty resume anxiety
        3. No network
        4. Interview panic
        5. Negotiation fear
        6. Imposter syndrome

    - concept: "Deliverables you'll create"
      explanation: |
        This isn't a "watch and forget" course — students build real
        things they'll use in their job search.
      example: |
        "By the end, you'll have: a polished resume, an optimized LinkedIn,
        5+ STAR stories, networking scripts, and a 90-day action plan.
        Real tools, not just information."

    - concept: "Daily Action Tracker"
      explanation: |
        The accountability system that makes this course work. Students
        who track daily get hired faster.
      example: |
        "This is your secret weapon. 5 minutes a day, log what you did.
        Students who use it consistently get hired 2x faster."

  worked_examples:
    - scenario: "Student with interview in 2 days"
      steps:
        - "Skip to Module 4: Interview Intel"
        - "Watch STAR method and common questions"
        - "Build quick story bank"
        - "Come back to earlier modules after interview"
      outcome: "Goes into interview prepared, then backtracks to fill gaps"

    - scenario: "Student who doesn't know where to start"
      steps:
        - "Take Module 6 first for mindset foundation"
        - "Then Module 1 for career direction"
        - "Follow recommended path from there"
      outcome: "Overcomes paralysis, builds confidence, then proceeds systematically"

  non_examples:
    - what: "Watching every video in order regardless of needs"
      why_wrong: |
        That's fine if you have time, but the course is designed to be
        flexible. Students with urgent needs should address those first.

    - what: "Skipping the Daily Action Tracker"
      why_wrong: |
        The tracker is where accountability happens. Without it, students
        often drift and lose momentum.

# =============================================================================
# APPLICATION
# =============================================================================

application:
  guided:
    - activity: "Identify your starting point"
      scaffolding: |
        Show the 6 problems on screen. Ask: "Which one is keeping you
        up at night? That's your starting point."
      feedback: |
        "If you chose more than one, that's normal. Pick the most
        urgent or start with Module 1 if unsure."

  independent:
    - activity: "Download course map"
      success_criteria: |
        Student has downloaded the visual course map and identified
        which path they'll take (recommended or custom).

# =============================================================================
# INTEGRATION
# =============================================================================

integration:
  reflection: |
    "Which of the 6 problems feels most urgent for you right now?
    What would change if you solved just that one problem?"

  transfer: |
    Students use the problem-centered structure throughout their job search.
    When a new challenge arises, they can return to the relevant module.

  share: |
    "If a friend asked what this course covers, how would you explain it?"

# =============================================================================
# INSTRUCTOR NOTES
# =============================================================================

instructor_notes:
  tone: |
    Clear, organized, empowering. The goal is to make the course feel
    manageable, not overwhelming. Emphasize flexibility and control.

  key_moments:
    - "Show the 6 problems visually — make it memorable"
    - "Demonstrate the flexibility (you're in control)"
    - "Preview deliverables to create anticipation"
    - "Plant the seed for Daily Action Tracker importance"

  avoid:
    - "Getting too detailed about every module"
    - "Making it sound like more work than it is"
    - "Rigid rules about order (emphasize flexibility)"

  visual_suggestions:
    - "Course map graphic with 6 modules"
    - "Deliverables checklist visual"
    - "Quick preview of Daily Action Tracker"
