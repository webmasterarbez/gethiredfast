# =============================================================================
# PROBLEM-CENTERED
# =============================================================================

problem_context: |
  Students are starting a job search course feeling overwhelmed, uncertain,
  and possibly skeptical. They don't know if this course will actually help
  or if it's just more generic career advice. They need to trust the
  instructor and believe the promise before they'll engage.

  The real problem: "Why should I believe this course will help me when
  everything else hasn't?"

# =============================================================================
# ACTIVATION
# =============================================================================

activation:
  prior_knowledge: |
    - They've likely tried job searching before with limited success
    - They've received generic career advice that didn't work
    - They may have watched other career content that felt disconnected
    - They understand the concept of "getting hired" even if mechanics are unclear

  connection: |
    Connect to their frustration with generic advice by acknowledging it
    directly. "Most career advice is written by people who've never hired
    anyone. I've been on the hiring side for 22 years."

  analogy: |
    Like having a friend who works at the restaurant and can tell you
    what's actually good vs. what the menu says — Cat is the insider
    who knows how hiring really works.

# =============================================================================
# DEMONSTRATION
# =============================================================================

demonstration:
  key_concepts:
    - concept: "Credibility through experience"
      explanation: |
        Cat has 22 years in recruiting, has reviewed 10,000+ resumes,
        and has hired thousands of people. This isn't theory — it's
        battle-tested knowledge.
      example: |
        "I've sat on the other side of the interview table. I know
        what makes me say 'yes' and what makes me say 'no' — and I'm
        going to tell you."

    - concept: "The course promise"
      explanation: |
        Find jobs 55% faster than average. Not a vague promise but a
        specific, measurable outcome based on proven methodology.
      example: |
        "The national average is 22 weeks to get hired. My students
        average 10 weeks or less. That's not magic — it's method."

    - concept: "Designed for you"
      explanation: |
        This course is specifically for community college students,
        not recycled content for executives or tech workers.
      example: |
        "I know you're working while studying. I know your resume
        feels thin. I know you might not have connections. This course
        is built for exactly where you are."

  worked_examples: []  # Not applicable for welcome video

  non_examples:
    - what: "Generic motivational speech with no substance"
      why_wrong: |
        Students are cynical about empty motivation. They need to see
        credibility and specific value, not cheerleading.

    - what: "Overwhelming them with everything they'll learn"
      why_wrong: |
        They're already overwhelmed. The welcome should simplify and
        reassure, not add to their cognitive load.

  independent:
    - activity: "Believe the promise"
      success_criteria: |
        Student feels hopeful and willing to engage with the course.
        They trust Cat and believe the promise is achievable.

# =============================================================================
# INTEGRATION
# =============================================================================

integration:
  reflection: |
    "What would it mean for you to find a job in 10 weeks instead of 22?
    What would change in your life?"

  transfer: |
    This lesson transfers by setting the emotional foundation. When students
    hit obstacles later, they remember "Cat said this was possible" and
    "Cat has been where I want to go."

  share: |
    Not applicable — this is private commitment, not shareable content.

# =============================================================================
# INSTRUCTOR NOTES
# =============================================================================

instructor_notes:
  tone: |
    Warm, confident, real. Not salesy or hype-y. Cat should feel like
    a mentor who genuinely cares, not a marketer selling a product.

  key_moments:
    - "Establish credibility early (22 years, hiring side)"
    - "Acknowledge their struggles without dwelling"
    - "Make the promise specific and believable"
    - "End with 'I've got your back' energy"

  avoid:
    - "Overwhelming with course structure details"
    - "Making it about Cat instead of about them"
    - "Promising things will be easy (they won't)"

  visual_suggestions:
    - "Direct to camera, warm setting"
    - "Brief B-roll of professional environments"
    - "Text overlay of '55% faster' stat"
