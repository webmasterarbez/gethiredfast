# TRANSFORMATION PROMISE
# =============================================================================

transformation:

  before:
    situation: |
      Community college students approaching graduation or job searching feel
      overwhelmed, under-qualified, and uncertain. They don't know where to
      start, their resumes feel empty, networking seems fake and scary, and
      imposter syndrome makes them question whether they belong in professional
      settings at all.
    pain_points:
      - "I don't know where to start"
      - "My resume has nothing on it"
      - "I don't know anyone who can help"
      - "Networking feels fake and uncomfortable"
      - "Everyone else seems to know what they're doing"
      - "What if they find out I'm not qualified?"
      - "I can't compete with people who have real experience"

  after:
    situation: |
      Students have a clear action plan, polished professional materials,
      networking confidence, and the insider knowledge to navigate the job
      market effectively. They understand their value, can articulate their
      story, and have the psychological resilience to handle rejection and
      keep moving forward.
    capabilities:
      - "Has a targeted job search strategy (not random applications)"
      - "Owns a polished, ATS-optimized resume"
      - "Can network confidently with scripts and templates"
      - "Knows how to ace interviews using the STAR method"
      - "Understands what they're worth and can negotiate"
      - "Has tools to manage imposter syndrome and rejection"
      - "Tracks progress with accountability system"

  promise:
    one_sentence: |
      Transform from overwhelmed and uncertain to confident and employed
      by learning what actually gets you hired — straight from someone
      who's been on the hiring side for 22 years.
    tagline: "From Overwhelmed to Employed"
    key_metric: "Find jobs 55% faster than average"

# =============================================================================
# UNIQUE THESIS / APPROACH
# =============================================================================

thesis:

  name: "The Insider's Edge + Inner Game"

  core_belief: |
    Getting hired isn't about being the most qualified candidate — it's about
    knowing how the hiring game actually works AND having the confidence to
    play it. Most career advice misses one or the other. This course delivers
    both.

  two_pillars:

    pillar_1:
      name: "The Insider's Playbook"
      description: |
        22 years on the hiring side reveals what actually gets candidates
        hired — the hidden job market, what resumes get thrown out and why,
        what interviewers really want to hear, and how to negotiate without
        losing the offer.
      proof_points:
        - "Recruiter perspective on every topic"
        - "Scripts for exactly what to say"
        - "Behind-the-scenes of hiring process"
        - "What 80% of job seekers get wrong"

    pillar_2:
      name: "The Inner Game"
      description: |
        Job searching is psychologically brutal, especially for students who
        already feel like imposters. This course addresses the mental game —
        building confidence, managing rejection, overcoming perfectionism,
        and maintaining momentum when things get hard.
      proof_points:
        - "Imposter syndrome strategies"
        - "Rejection resilience training"
        - "Daily Action Tracker for accountability"
        - "Mindset exercises throughout (not just one module)"

  differentiation: |
    Competitors offer tactics OR motivation. LinkedIn Learning has 24,000
    scattered courses. Big Interview focuses only on interviews. YouTube
    is chaos. We offer a complete system: the insider knowledge you need
    PLUS the psychological support to actually use it.

# =============================================================================
# COURSE VISION
# =============================================================================

vision:

  mission: |
    Empower community college students to launch their careers with confidence
    by teaching them what actually works in job searching — from someone who's
    hired thousands of people — while supporting them through the psychological
    challenges that derail most job seekers.

  values:
    - value: "Practical over theoretical"
      meaning: "Every lesson ends with 'do this next'"

    - value: "Honest over polished"
      meaning: "Tell them the truth about the job market, even when it's hard"

    - value: "Supportive over preachy"
      meaning: "Meet them where they are, don't lecture"

    - value: "Action over perfection"
      meaning: "Done is better than perfect; applied is better than watched"

  success_definition: |
    Success is not course completion — it's getting hired. Every design
    decision should ask: "Does this help students get jobs faster?"

# =============================================================================
# PROBLEM-CENTERED STRUCTURE
# =============================================================================

structure_philosophy:

  approach: "Problem-Topic Focused"

  rationale: |
    Students don't think in "weeks" — they think in problems. "How do I
    write a resume when I have no experience?" "What do I say in a
    networking conversation?" Organize around the problems they're
    trying to solve, not arbitrary time units.

  core_problems:
    - problem: "WTF Should I Do With My Life?"
      topics:
        - "Career exploration and self-assessment"
        - "Identifying transferable skills"
        - "Target job identification"
        - "AI and the future of work"

    - problem: "My Resume Has Nothing On It"
      topics:
        - "Framing limited experience"
        - "ATS optimization"
        - "AI tools for resume writing"
        - "LinkedIn profile building"

    - problem: "I Don't Know Anyone"
      topics:
        - "Hidden job market access"
        - "Networking without feeling fake"
        - "Informational interviews"
        - "Using Handshake and modern platforms"

    - problem: "Help! I Have An Interview"
      topics:
        - "STAR method mastery"
        - "Common question preparation"
        - "AI video interviews (HireVue)"
        - "Company research and follow-up"

    - problem: "Can I Actually Ask For More?"
      topics:
        - "Salary research"
        - "Negotiation at entry level"
        - "Total compensation understanding"
        - "Offer evaluation"

    - problem: "I'm Not Good Enough (And Other Lies)"
      topics:
        - "Imposter syndrome strategies"
        - "Rejection resilience"
        - "Perfectionism breaking"
        - "Confidence building"

  integration_note: |
    Mindset content should be woven throughout ALL modules, not just
    the last one. Every problem-topic should address both the tactical
    solution AND the psychological barrier.
