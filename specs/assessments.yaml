# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# =============================================================================

philosophy:
  approach: "portfolio_based"

  rationale: |
    This course uses portfolio-based assessment rather than traditional testing.
    Job search success is measured by what you PRODUCE and DO, not what you
    know. Every assessment results in a tangible deliverable students can use
    in their actual job search.

  principles:
    - "Assessments ARE the learning — creating deliverables teaches skills"
    - "Every assessment produces something useful for the real job search"
    - "Self-assessment builds metacognition and self-correction"
    - "Low-stakes knowledge checks reinforce key concepts"
    - "No high-stakes exams — reduce anxiety, increase action"
