  statement: |
    For community college students who feel overwhelmed, under-qualified, and
    uncertain about how to launch their careers, Get Hired Fast is the only
    comprehensive job search course that combines a recruiter's insider playbook
    with psychological support and step-by-step guidance, helping students find

    with built-in accountability. Created by a recruiter with 22 years of
    hiring experience, it's the course she wishes every candidate had taken.
