# REQUIRED PREREQUISITES
# =============================================================================

required:

  - id: REQ-01
    category: "Education Status"
    requirement: "Currently enrolled in or recently graduated from community college"
    rationale: |
      Course content, examples, and tone are specifically designed for
      community college students. While others may benefit, the course
      assumes this context.
    verification: "Self-reported during enrollment"
    flexibility: |
      Trade school students, certificate program students, and recent
      community college graduates (within 1 year) are also appropriate.

  - id: REQ-02
    category: "Technology Access"
    requirement: "Access to a device with internet (computer, tablet, or smartphone)"
    rationale: |
      Course is delivered online. All content is accessible on any device.
    verification: "Implicit (can access course)"
    flexibility: |
      Course is mobile-optimized. Students can complete on phone if needed.

  - id: REQ-03
    category: "Language"
    requirement: "English proficiency sufficient to watch videos and write professional documents"
    rationale: |
      Course is in English. Resume and LinkedIn creation require writing ability.
    verification: "Self-selected"
    flexibility: |
      Non-native speakers welcome. AI tools taught in course can help
      with grammar and phrasing.

# =============================================================================
# RECOMMENDED PREREQUISITES
# =============================================================================

recommended:

  - id: REC-01
    category: "Job Search Stage"
    recommendation: "Actively job searching or planning to within 3 months"
    rationale: |
      Course is most effective when students can immediately apply what
      they learn. Taking it "someday" reduces retention and impact.
    without_this: |
      Students not actively searching may complete course but won't see
      immediate results. Consider encouraging them to wait until ready.

  - id: REC-02
    category: "Time Availability"
    recommendation: "Can dedicate 1-2 hours per week for 5 weeks"
    rationale: |
      While self-paced, momentum matters for job search motivation.
      Completing over 5 weeks maintains engagement.
    without_this: |
      Students can stretch course over longer period, but may lose
      motivation. Daily Action Tracker helps maintain accountability.

  - id: REC-03
    category: "Existing Materials"
    recommendation: "Has some form of resume draft (even rough)"
    rationale: |
      Starting from scratch takes longer. Having something to improve
      creates faster wins.
    without_this: |
      Course includes resume creation from scratch, but students should
      expect to spend more time in Problem Area 2.

  - id: REC-04
    category: "LinkedIn Account"
    recommendation: "Has a LinkedIn account (even basic/incomplete)"
    rationale: |
      Course teaches LinkedIn optimization. Having an existing account
      speeds up the process.
    without_this: |
      Students will need to create an account. Add 15-30 minutes to
      LinkedIn section.

  interpretation:
    high_scores: |
      Students scoring 15+ may already have some foundations. Encourage
      them to still complete all sections but may move faster through
      Problem Areas 1-2.

    medium_scores: |
      Students scoring 10-14 are typical for this course. Recommend
      following the suggested problem area sequence.

    low_scores: |
      Students scoring below 10 are ideal candidates. Emphasize that
      the course is designed exactly for their situation. Start with
      Problem Area 6 (Mindset) if anxiety is high.
