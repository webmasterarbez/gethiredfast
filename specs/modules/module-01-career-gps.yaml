        "Here's a secret: most people who seem like they have it all
        figured out? They don't. They just started somewhere. That's
        what you're going to do today."
      objectives: |
        By the end of this lesson, you'll have a framework for exploring
        career options that works even when you feel completely lost.
      recall: |
        Think about a class, project, or activity where you lost track
        of time because you were so engaged. That's a clue.

        - Why "what do you want to do?" is the wrong question
        - The 3 factors: interests, skills, market demand
        - How to explore without committing forever

      guidance: |

        to pay the bills."
      retention: |
        "In the next lesson, we'll identify your hidden superpowers —
        skills you don't even realize you have."

        Identify at least 10 transferable skills from your experiences.

        Research 3-5 potential roles → Score each on the scorecard →
        Identify your top 2-3 targets.
