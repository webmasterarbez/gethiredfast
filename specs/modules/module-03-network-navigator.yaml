    objectives:
      - "Understand why 70% of jobs are filled through networking"

    gagne_events:

        "Here's a stat that changes everything: 70% of jobs are never
        posted publicly. They're filled through referrals and networking.
        If you're only applying online, you're competing for 30% of
        opportunities."
      objectives: |
        Understand why networking is essential and how it works.
      recall: |
        Think about jobs you've heard about through friends or family.
        That's the hidden job market in action.

        - Why employers prefer referrals
        - What "networking" actually means (not schmoozing)
        - How to network when you're an introvert

        "In the next lesson, you'll discover you know more people than
        you think."

        person? That one shift changes everything."
