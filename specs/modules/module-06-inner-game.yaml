        "70% of people experience imposter syndrome at some point. Maya
        Angelou, Albert Einstein, Michelle Obama — all admitted to feeling
        like frauds. If they felt it, maybe it's not a sign that you're
        actually a fraud. Maybe it's just... normal."
      objectives: |
        Understand imposter syndrome and recognize when it's affecting you.

        "'I'm not qualified.' 'They'll find out I'm faking.' 'Everyone
        else knows what they're doing.' Sound familiar? These are lies
        your brain tells you. Let's learn to talk back."
      objectives: |
        Learn to recognize and reframe imposter thoughts.
      recall: |

        - The cognitive reframe technique
        - Evidence-based countering
        - Demo: reframing "I'm not qualified"

      guidance: |
        "The thought 'I'm not qualified' becomes 'I have X, Y, Z skills
        that are relevant, and I'm learning the rest.' Facts beat feelings."
      practice: |
        Identify 3 imposter thoughts → Write reframe for each →
        Create reframe cards to keep
      feedback: |
        "If a reframe doesn't feel true, adjust it. It should be
        believable, not just positive."
      retention: |
        "Put these cards where you'll see them. Phone wallpaper, bathroom
        mirror, wherever the doubt hits."

      attention: |
        "The average job seeker applies to 100+ jobs to get one offer.

        you'll get hired."
      retention: |
        "When rejection hits, give yourself 24 hours to feel it. Then
        log an action in your tracker and keep moving."
