    type: practice
    duration: "15 minutes"
    format: video + activity

    description: |
      Guided creation of a personalized 90-day job search plan using
      everything learned in the course. Specific, actionable, and
      time-bound.

    objectives:
      - "Create a 90-day action plan with specific milestones"
      - "Integrate all course deliverables into a system"
      - "Commit to measurable weekly actions"

    gagne_events:
      attention: |
        "You've built the tools. You've got the skills. Now let's put
        it all together into a plan that gets you hired in the next
        90 days."
      objectives: |
        Create your personalized 90-day job search action plan.
      recall: |
        Review all the deliverables you've created: resume, LinkedIn,
        STAR stories, network map, scripts, research. These are your
        weapons.
      content:
        - The 90-day framework
        - Phase 1 (Days 1-30): Foundation and outreach
        - Phase 2 (Days 31-60): Momentum and interviews
        - Phase 3 (Days 61-90): Negotiations and offers
        - Weekly action minimums
        - Milestone checkpoints
      guidance: |
        "Your plan should be specific. 'Apply to jobs' isn't a plan.
        'Apply to 10 targeted jobs per week using tailored resumes'
        is a plan."
      practice: |
        Complete the 90-day plan template → Set weekly targets →
        Identify your first 3 actions for tomorrow
      feedback: |

        plan you follow beats an ambitious plan you abandon."
      retention: |
        "Post this plan somewhere visible. Review it weekly. Adjust
        as you learn what works."
