type:
  format: self-paced
  rationale: |
    Community college students have unpredictable schedules due to work,
    family, and class commitments. Self-paced allows them to learn when
    they have time, which increases completion rates for this audience.

# PROBLEM-CENTERED STRUCTURE
# =============================================================================

structure:

  philosophy: |
    This course is organized around PROBLEMS, not arbitrary time units.
    Students don't wake up thinking "It's Week 3!" — they think "I have
    an interview tomorrow, what do I do?" The structure meets them where
    they are with solutions to specific challenges.

    paralyzed by imposter syndrome, they start with Problem 6. The structure
    serves the learner, not the other way around.

# PACING
# =============================================================================

pacing:

  recommended: "One problem area per week (5-7 hours total over 5 weeks)"
  minimum: "Complete at your own pace"
  maximum: "Lifetime access"

  suggested_approach: |
    Most students complete one problem area per week, spending about 45-90
    minutes per section. However, the course is designed to be completed
    faster if job searching urgently, or spread out if balancing other
    commitments.

  daily_action_tracker:
    description: |
      The Daily Action Tracker is the accountability backbone. Students
      log job search activities daily, building habits and visibility
      into what's working.
    frequency: "Daily (5-10 minutes)"
    components:
      - "Activity logging"
      - "Progress tracking"
      - "Win celebration"
      - "What's working analysis"

  escalation:

      is designed to complement, not replace, career services.

# =============================================================================
# MOBILE OPTIMIZATION
# =============================================================================

  priority: "Mobile-first"
  rationale: |
    Community college students are often commuting, working, or between
    classes. Course must work perfectly on phones.

    - "Worksheets fillable on mobile or printable"
    - "Text readable without zooming"
    - "No features requiring desktop-only software"

# =============================================================================
# COMPLETION DEFINITION
# =============================================================================

completion:

  definition: |
    A student is considered "complete" when they have finished all core
    problem areas and produced the key deliverables. However, the real
    measure of success is getting hired, not course completion.

  requirements:
    - "All 6 problem areas completed"
    - "Key deliverables produced (resume, LinkedIn, STAR stories)"
    - "Daily Action Tracker used for at least 2 weeks"

  certification:
    type: "Certificate of Completion"
    issued: "Upon completing all requirements"
    value: |
      The certificate demonstrates commitment to career development,
      but the portfolio of deliverables (resume, LinkedIn) is more
      valuable than the certificate itself.
