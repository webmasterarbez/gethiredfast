# =============================================================================
# BLOOM'S TAXONOMY DISTRIBUTION
# =============================================================================

blooms_distribution:
  summary: |
    The learning outcomes are intentionally weighted toward Apply (skill execution)
    and Create (producing deliverables) because this is a skills-based course
    where learners must DO, not just know.

  breakdown:
    Remember: 0
    Understand: 2
    Apply: 18
    Analyze: 4
    Evaluate: 3
    Create: 3

  rationale: |
    - Heavy Apply focus: Job searching is a skill requiring practice
    - Create outcomes: Learners leave with tangible deliverables (resume, LinkedIn, etc.)
    - Evaluate outcomes: Offer evaluation and decision-making require judgment
    - Minimal Remember/Understand: Information without application is useless

# OUTCOME-TO-ASSESSMENT MAPPING
# =============================================================================
