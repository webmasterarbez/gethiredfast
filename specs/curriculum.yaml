# CURRICULUM PHILOSOPHY
# =============================================================================

philosophy:

  structure: "Problem-Centered"

  rationale: |
    This curriculum is organized around 6 core problems that job seekers face,
    not arbitrary weekly modules. Students can enter at any problem based on
    their immediate needs, though a recommended path exists for those starting
    from scratch.

  design_principles:
    - "Each module solves a specific, named problem"
    - "Every lesson ends with a clear action or deliverable"
    - "Mindset content woven throughout, not isolated"
    - "10-15 minute videos maximum for mobile learners"
    - "Scripts and templates reduce activation energy"
