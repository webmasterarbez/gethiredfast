  # CAREER PLANNING (LONG-TERM)
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - category: "Long-Term Career Planning"
    topics:
      - name: "5-10 year career pathing"
        reason: |
          Focus is on getting first/next job, not long-term planning.
          Students need a job before they can think about career trajectory.

      - name: "Graduate school planning"
        reason: |
          Out of scope. CC students focused on entering workforce.
          May revisit education later but not immediate priority.

      - name: "Executive/senior-level job search"
        reason: |
          Different strategies required. Course is for entry-level.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC DEEP DIVES
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

      - name: "Executive presence and leadership branding"
        reason: "Not relevant for entry-level"

      - name: "International job search"
        reason: "US-focused course; international requires visa expertise"

      - name: "Freelancing and self-employment"
        reason: "Different model; course assumes traditional employment"

      - name: "Entrepreneurship"
        reason: "Different career path entirely"

  # EMPLOYMENT LAW & HR
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

      - name: "HR policy interpretation"

# =============================================================================
# BOUNDARY DECISIONS
# =============================================================================

boundary_decisions:

  - decision: "Include AI tools as practical how-to, not comprehensive training"
    rationale: |
      AI is changing fast. Teach principles and current best practices,
      but acknowledge tools will evolve. Focus on critical thinking about
      AI output, not mastery of specific tools.

  - decision: "Address discrimination/bias but don't provide legal advice"
    rationale: |
      Students face real challenges (ageism, bias). Acknowledge and provide
      practical strategies, but refer to appropriate resources for legal matters.

  - decision: "Cover negotiation for entry-level specifically"
    rationale: |
      General negotiation advice often doesn't apply to entry-level.
      Tailor specifically to the constraints and opportunities of first jobs.

  - decision: "Mindset content woven throughout, not standalone"
    rationale: |
      Psychological barriers appear at every stage. Don't isolate mindset
      to one section — address imposter syndrome when discussing resumes,
      rejection when discussing networking, etc.

  - decision: "Focus on US job market"
    rationale: |
      Platform specifics (LinkedIn, Handshake), salary research tools,
      and negotiation norms are US-centric. International students in
      US colleges can benefit, but seeking jobs abroad is out of scope.
